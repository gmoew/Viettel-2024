3,"Brad has done some research and determined a certain set of systems on his
network fail once every ten years. The purchase price for each of these systems
is $1200. Additionally, Brad discovers the administrators on staff, who earn$50 an hour, estimate five hours to replace a machine. Five employees, earning$25 an hour, depend on each system and will be completely unproductive whileit is down. If you were to ask Brad for an ALE on these devices, what should behis answer?
A. $2075
B. $207.50
C. $120
D. $1200","B. ALE = ARO × SLE. To determine ARO, divide the number of occurrences bythe number of years (1 occurrence/10 years = 0.1). To determine SLE, add thepurchase cost (1200) plus the amount of time to replace (5 × 50 = 250) plus theamount of lost work (5 hours × 5 employees × 25 = 625). In this case, it all addsup to $2075. ALE = 0.1 × 2075, or $207.50."

37,"You're running an IDLE scan and send the first packet to the target machine. Next, the SYN/ACK packet is sent to the zombie. The IPID on the return packet from the zombie is 36754. If the starting IPID was 36753, in what state is the port on the target machine?   

A. Open
B. Closed
C. Unknown
D. None of the above","B. Since the IPID incremented by only one, this means the zombie hasn’t sent
anything since your original SYN/ACK to figure out the starting IPID. If theIPID had increased by two, then the port would be open because the zombiewould have responded to the target machine’s SYN/ACK."

A. Ping sweep
B. XMAS
C. Stealth
D. Full","C. ECC defines as a stealth scan what most of us used to call a half-open scan
(although I suppose it would actually make more sense mathematically to call it
a two-thirds scan, since it’s a three-way handshake and only two are used). This is
also known as a SYN scan."
40,"Which of the following statements is true regarding port scanning?

A. Port scanning's primary goal is to identify live targets on a network.
B. Port scanning is designed to overload the ports on a target in order to identify which are open and which are closed.
C. Port scanning is designed as a method to view all traffic to and from a system.
D. Port scanning is used to identify potential vulnerabilities on a target system.","D. Port scanning has a singular purpose—to knock on ports and see if they’re
open (listening). Does an open port necessarily mean something is wrong? No,
but it does represent a potential vulnerability you can exploit later.

A. Active sniffing is usually required when hubs are in place.
B. Active sniffing is usually required when switches are in place.
C. Active sniffing is harder to detect than passive sniffing.
D. Active sniffing is easier to detect than passive sniffing.","B, D. If you’re on a hub, why bother with active sniffing techniques? You’re
already seeing everything. Also, active sniffing is much more likely to get you
caught than simply plugging in a wire and sitting back.

A. False negative
B. False positive
C. True negative
D. True positive","A. When traffic gets to the IDS, is examined, and is still let through even thoughit’s malicious, a false negative has occurred. And a false negative is really, really bad."
48,"Machine A (with MAC address 00-01-02-AA-BB-CC) and Machine B(00-01-02-BB-CC-DD) are on the same subnet. Machine C, with address
00-01-02-CC-DD-EE, is on a different subnet. While the attacker is sniffingon the fully switched network, Machine B sends a message to Machine C.
If an attacker on Machine A wanted to receive a copy of this message, which of
the following circumstances would be necessary?
A. The ARP cache of the router would need to be poisoned, changing the entryfor Machine A to 00-01-02-CC-DD-EE.

sensitive information. Which social engineering attack was this?
A. Phishing
B. Vishing
C. Smishing
D. Man in the middle","C. The term smishing refers to the use of text messages to socially engineer mobiledevice users. By definition it is a mobile-based social engineering attack. As anaside, it also sounds like something a five-year-old would say about killing a bug."

145,"A security team is implementing various security controls across the organization. After
considering several configurations and applications, a final agreed-on set of security
controls is put into place; however, not all risks are mitigated by the controls. Of the
following, which is the next best step?
A. Continue applying controls until all risk is eliminated.
B. Ignore any remaining risk as “best effort controlled.”
C. Ensure that any remaining risk is residual or low and accept the risk.
D. Remove all controls","C. Remember at the beginning of this chapter when I said the process of eliminationmay be your best bet in some cases? Well, even if you aren’t well-versed in risk
management and security control efforts, you could narrow this down to the correct
answer. It is impossible to remove all risk from any system and still have it usable. I’mcertain there are exceptions to this rule (maybe super-secret machines in undergroundvaults buried deep within the earth, running on geothermal-powered batteries,
without any network access at all and controlled by a single operator who hasn’t seen
daylight in many years), but in general the goal of security teams has always been to
reduce risk to an acceptable level."
146,"A Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) follows a specific methodology for testing a system.
Which step comes after footprinting in the CEH methodology?
A. Scanning
B. Enumeration
C. Reconnaissance
D. Application attack","A. CEH methodology is laid out this way: reconnaissance (footprinting), scanningand enumeration, gaining access, escalating privileges, maintaining access, andcovering tracks. While you may be groaning about scanning and enumerationboth appearing as answers, they’re placed here in this way on purpose. This examis not only testing your rote memorization of the methodology but also how the
methodology actually works. Remember, after scoping out the recon on your target,
your next step is to scan it. After all, you have to know what targets are there first
before enumerating information about them."
147,"Your organization is planning for the future and is identifying the systems and processes
critical for their continued operation. Which of the following best describes this effort?
A. BCP
B. BIA
C. DRP
D. ALE","B. A business impact analysis (BIA) best matches this description. In a BIA, the
organization looks at all the systems and processes in use and determines which ones
are absolutely critical to continued operation. Additionally, the assessor (the person or
company conducting the analysis) will look at all the existing security architecture andmake an evaluation on the likelihood of any system or resource being compromised.
Part of this is assigning values to systems and services, determining the maximumtolerable downtime (MTD) for any, and identifying any overlooked vulnerabilities."
148,"Which incident response (IR) phase is responsible for setting rules, identifying the
workforce and roles, and creating backup and test plans for the organization?
A. Preparation
B. Identification
C. Containment
D. Recovery","A. So even if you weren’t aware of incident response phases, this one should’ve been
a rather easy guess. In the preparation phase, your IR (incident response) team should
be preparing for an incident. Preparation includes lots of things—some of which are
mentioned here. But virtually anything you can think of that does not involve actions
taken during the incident belongs here. Training, exercises, and policies are all examples.
As an aside, IR phases can be different depending on whom you ask and what
the moon phase is, but generally IR is broken down into six phases: preparation,
identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Preparation
we already covered. Identification refers to the steps taken to verify it’s actually an
incident, and all the information surrounding that—source, destination(s), exploit
used, malware used, and so on. Containment is the step used to cordon off the
infected system(s) and prevent any further spread of infection or attack. Eradication
refers to steps taken to remove the malware (or other attack-related residuals, such
as backdoors). Recovery involves the steps taken to rebuild and restore the system(s)
and network to pre-attack status (with better security, I might add). Finally, lessons
learned is exactly what it sounds like, and it should feed right back into your
organization’s preparation phase."
149,"You’ve been hired as part of a pen test team. During the brief, you learn the client wants
the pen test attack to simulate a normal user who finds ways to elevate privileges and
create attacks. Which test type does the client want?
A. White box
B. Gray box
C. Black box
D. Hybrid","B. A gray-box test is designed to replicate an inside attacker. Otherwise known as
the partial knowledge attack (don’t forget this term), the idea is to simulate a user onthe inside who might know a little about the network, directory structure, and other
resources in your enterprise. You’ll probably find this one to be the most enlighteningattack in out-briefing your clients in the real world—it’s amazing what you can get
to when you’re a trusted, inside user. As an aside, you’ll often find in the real worldthat gray-box testing can also refer to a test where any inside information is given toa pen tester—you don’t necessarily need to be a fully knowledgeable inside user. Inother words, if you have usable information handed to you about your client, you’reperforming gray-box testing."
150,"Which of the following is defined as ensuring the enforcement of organizational securitypolicy does not rely on voluntary user compliance by assigning sensitivity labels oninformation and comparing this to the level of security a user is operating at?
A. Mandatory access control
B. Authorized access control
C. Role-based access control
D. Discretionary access control","A. Access control is defined as the selective restraint of access to a resource, and there
are several overall mechanisms to accomplish this goal. Mandatory access control
(MAC) is one type that constrains the ability of a subject to access or perform an
operation on an object by assigning and comparing “sensitivity labels.” Suppose a
person (or a process) attempts to access or edit a file. With MAC, a label is placed onthe file indicating its security level. If the entity attempting to access it does not have
that level, or higher, then access is denied. With mandatory access control, security
is centrally controlled by a security policy administrator, and users do not have the
ability to override security settings.
This should not be confused with role-based access control (RBAC) systems,
which may actually use MAC to get the job done. The difference is in whether the
information itself has a labeled description or whether the person accessing it has
their own label. For example, in a classified area, the information classified as Top
Secret will have a label on it identifying it as such, while you, as an auditor, will
have your own clearance and need-to-know label allowing you to access certain
information. MAC is a property of an object; RBAC is a property of someone
accessing an object."
151,"Which of the following statements is true regarding the TCP three-way handshake?
A. The recipient sets the initial sequence number in the second step.
B. The sender sets the initial sequence number in the third step.
C. When accepting the communications request, the recipient responds with anacknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the second step.
D. When accepting the communications request, the recipient responds with anacknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the third step.","C. The three-way handshake will definitely show up on your exam, and in much
trickier wording than this. It’s easy enough to memorize “SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK,”
but you’ll need more than that for the exam.
In step 1, the host sends a segment to the server, indicating it wants to open a
communications session. Inside this segment, the host turns on the SYN flag and sets
an initial sequence number (any random 32-bit number). When the recipient gets
the segment, it crafts a segment in response to let the host know it’s open and readyfor the communications session. It does this by turning on the SYN and ACK flags,
acknowledging the initial sequence number by incrementing it, and adding its ownunique sequence number. Then, when the host gets this response back, it sends onemore segment before the comm channel opens. In this segment, it sets the ACK flagand acknowledges the other’s sequence number by incrementing it.
For example, suppose Host A is trying to open a channel with Server B. In this
example, Host A likes the sequence number 2000, while Server B likes 5000. The
first segment would look like this: SYN=1, ACK=0, ISN=2000. The response
segment would look like this: SYN=1, ACK=1, ISN=5000, ACK NO=2001. The
third and final segment would appear this way: SYN=0, ACK=1, SEQ NO=2001,
ACK NO=5001."
152,"Your network contains certain servers that typically fail once every five years. The total cost
of one of these servers is $1000. Server technicians are paid $40 per hour, and a typical
replacement requires two hours. Ten employees, earning an average of $20 per hour, relyon these servers, and even one of them going down puts the whole group in a wait stateuntil it’s brought back up. Which of the following represents the ARO for a server?
A. $296
B. $1480
C. $1000
D. 0.20","D. When performing business impact analysis (or any other value analysis for that
matter), the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is an important measurement for everyasset. To compute the ALE, multiply the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) by thesingle loss expectancy (SLE). The ARO is the frequency at which a failure occurs onan annual basis. In this example, servers fail once every five years, so the ARO wouldbe 1 failure / 5 years = 20 percent."
153,"An ethical hacker is given no prior knowledge of the network and has a specific frameworkin which to work. The agreement specifies boundaries, nondisclosure agreements, and acompletion date definition. Which of the following statements is true?
A. A white hat is attempting a black-box test.
B. A white hat is attempting a white-box test.
C. A black hat is attempting a black-box test.
D. A black hat is attempting a gray-box test.","A. I love these types of questions. Not only is this a two-for-one question, but it
involves identical but confusing descriptors, causing all sorts of havoc. The answer
to attacking such questions—and you will see them, by the way—is to take each
section one at a time. Start with what kind of hacker he is. He’s hired under a
specific agreement, with full knowledge and consent of the target, thus making hima white hat. That eliminates C and D right off the bat. Second, to address what
kind of test he’s performing, simply look at what he knows about the system. In this
instance, he has no prior knowledge at all (apart from the agreement), thus making
it a black-box test."
154,"Which of the following is a detective control?
A. Audit trail
B. CONOPS
C. Procedure
D. Smartcard authentication
E. Process","A. A detective control is an effort used to identify problems, errors, or (in the case of
post-attack discovery) cause or evidence of an exploited vulnerability—and an audit
log or trail is a perfect example. Ideally, detective controls should be in place andworking such that errors can be corrected as quickly as possible. Many compliance
laws and standards (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is one example) mandate the useof detective controls."
155,"As part of a pen test on a U.S. government system, you discover files containing Social
Security numbers and other sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). You
are asked about controls placed on the dissemination of this information. Which of the
following acts should you check?
A. FISMA
B. Privacy Act
C. PATRIOT Act
D. Freedom of Information Act","B. The Privacy Act of 1974 protects information of a personal nature, including
Social Security numbers. The Privacy Act defines exactly what “personal information”is, and it states that government agencies cannot disclose any personal informationabout an individual without that person’s consent. It also lists 12 exemptions for therelease of this information (for example, information that is part of a law enforcement
issue may be released). In other questions you see, keep in mind that the Privacy Act
generally will define the information that is not available to you during and after a test.
Dissemination and storage of private information needs to be closely controlled to keep you out of hot water. As a side note, how you obtain PII is oftentimes just as
important as how you protect it once discovered. In your real-world adventures, keep
the Wiretap Act (18 U.S. Code Chapter 119—Wire and Electronic Communications
Interception and Interception of Oral Communications) and others like it in mind. "
156,"In which step of the Cyber Kill Chain methodology would an adversary create a deliverable
malicious payload?
A. Command and Control (C2)
B. Weaponization
C. Installation
D. Exploitation","B. Originally developed from a military model by Lockheed Martin (https://
lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) seeking to
quantify how to identify, prepare to attack, engage, and destroy the cyber enemy
target, the Cyber Kill Chain is a methodology for tracing the stages of a cyberattack.
Covering everything from early reconnaissance to data exfiltration (or worse), it
has evolved to help security professionals better understand and combat adversarial
efforts. The methodology includes seven steps—Reconnaissance, Weaponization,
Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control (C2), and Actions on
Objectives—detailing an attack from inception to closure. In the Weaponization
stage, adversaries create the deliverable malicious payload using an exploit, and in the
next stage, Delivery, they send it merrily along the way."
157,"An organization’s leadership is concerned about social engineering and hires a company to
provide training for all employees. How is the organization handling the risk associated
with social engineering?
A. They are accepting the risk.
B. They are avoiding the risk.
C. They are mitigating the risk.
D. They are transferring the risk.","C. When it comes to risks, there are four different methods of attempting to deal
with them. In risk mitigation, steps are taken to reduce the chance that the risk evenwill occur, and in this example that’s exactly what’s happening. Training on social
engineering should help reduce the likelihood an employee will fall victim (real-lifeconcerns on this notwithstanding—we are talking about test questions here)."
158,"In which phase of the ethical hacking methodology would a hacker be expected to discover
available targets on a network?
A. Reconnaissance
B. Scanning and enumeration
C. Gaining access
D. Maintaining access
E. Covering tracks","B. The scanning and enumeration phase is where you’ll use things such as
ping sweeps to discover available targets on the network. This step occurs after
reconnaissance. In this step, tools and techniques are actively applied to informationgathered during recon to obtain more in-depth information on the targets. For
example, reconnaissance may show a network subnet to have 500 or so machines
connected inside a single building, whereas scanning and enumeration would
discover which ones are Windows machines and which ones are running FTP. As an
aside, it’s important to remember these phases and definitions are exactly what you’ll
need to pass your exam, but in the real world, actions and findings don’t necessarily
fit cleanly into predefined roles and definitions."

A. Air conditioning
B. Security tokens
C. Fire alarms
D. Security policy","B. A logical (or technical) control is one used for identification, authentication,

their intent to discover security flaws and possible remediation. They seem particularlyconcerned about internal threats from the user base. Which of the following best describes
the test type the client is looking for?
A. Gray box
B. Black box
C. White hat
D. Black hat","A. Once again, this is a play on words the exam will throw at you. Note the questionis asking about a test type, not the attacker. Reviewing CEH documentation, you’ll
see there are three types of tests—white, black, and gray—with each designed totest a specific threat. White tests the internal threat of a knowledgeable systems
administrator or an otherwise elevated privilege level user. Black tests external threats
with no knowledge of the target. Gray tests the average internal user threat to exposepotential security problems inside the network."
163,"In which phase of the attack would a hacker set up and configure “zombie” machines?
A. Reconnaissance
B. Covering tracks
C. Gaining access
D. Maintaining access","D. Zombies are basically machines hackers commandeer to do their work for them.
If the attacker is really good, the owners of the zombie machines don’t even knowtheir machines have been drafted into the war. There are a bajillion methods for
maintaining access on a machine you’ve already compromised, and maintaining
that access does not necessarily mean the system will be used as a zombie—you
could, for example, simply want to check in from time to time to see what new juicy
information the user has decided to leave in a file or folder for you, or to check on
new logins, credentials, and so on. However, configuring zombie systems definitely
belongs in this phase"
164,"Which of the following should not be included in a security policy?
A. Policy exceptions
B. Details on noncompliance disciplinary actions
C. Technical details and procedures
D. Supporting document references","C. The whole policy/standard/procedure/guideline thing can get confusing sometimes. A policy is a high-level document that doesn’t get down and dirty into technical details/specifications and is intended to improve awareness. Policies are mandatory, generally short, and easy to understand, providing everyone with the rules of the road. Standards are mandatory rules designed to support a policy, and they must include one or more specifications for hardware, software, or behavior. Procedures are stepby-step instructions for completing a task. Guidelines are not mandatory but rather are recommendations for accomplishing a goal or on how to act in a given situation"

prioritize, and resolve security incidents?
A. Incident management
B. Vulnerability management
C. Change management
D. Patch management","A. Admittedly, this one is fairly easy—or at least it should be. Incident management
is the process of dealing with incidents and generally always has the same features/
steps—identify the problem or root cause, analyze and research the issue, containthe malicious effort, eradicate the effort, and resolve any damage caused. ECCdefines the process as having eight steps: 1. Preparation, 2. Detection and Analysis,
3. Classification/Prioritization, 4. Notification, 5. Containment, 6. Forensic
Investigation, 7. Eradication and Recovery, and 8. Post-incident Activities. The
incident response team (IRT) is charged with handling this process."
166,"During an assessment, your pen test team discovers child porn on a system. Which of the
following is the appropriate response?
A. Continue testing and report findings at the out-brief.
B. Continue testing but report findings to the business owners.
C. Cease testing immediately and refuse to continue work for the client.
D. Cease testing immediately and contact authorities","D. I hesitated to add this question, for reasons that are obvious and some that aren’t,
but in the interest of covering everything, I felt I must. First and foremost, in the real
world, discovery of something that you think might be illegal activity puts you and
your team in a very, very tricky spot. Should you accuse fill-in-the-blank of a crime
and involve the authorities, you could be setting yourself up for lawsuits and all sorts
of trouble. On the other hand, if you ignore it, you might be found complicit, or
at the very least negligent. In the real world, the answer is to make sure your scope
agreement advises you and the client of your duty regarding potential criminal
activity found during the scope of your investigation. No guessing is allowed—it
better be iron-clad evidence, obvious to all, or you’re in a world of hurt. Finally, what
potentially illegal activity you discover may determine your response regardless of the
ROE (rules of engagement). If you discover child porn, you could be guilty of a crime
for not reporting it, which isn’t necessarily true for many other crimes. For example,
if you witness someone breaking into a house across your street, or were performing
a pen test and reasonably suspected someone had already compromised the network,
you are not compelled by law, in most states, to notify authorities. However, if you
witness bodily harm, you likely would be compelled by law in most states. Speaking
purely academically, it’s fairly clear cut and will be so on your exam. In the real world,
the true answer is to know the laws regarding your testing very well, and make sure
your team has a good lawyer.
In this example, however, the choices present make this relatively easy. ECC wants
ethical hackers to report any illegal activity they find. Period. Possession of child
porn is a crime no matter what, so again in this particular case, stop your testing and
report it to the authorities."

A. An external vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server threat.
B. An external threat can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server vulnerability.
C. An internal vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server threat.

is any weakness, such as a software flaw or logic design, that could be exploited bya threat to cause damage to an asset. In both these answers, the vulnerability—the

for extracting metadata of public documents (.pdf, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .docx, .pptx,
.xlsx) belonging to a target company. It performs a search in Google to identify
and download the documents to local disk and then will extract the metadata with
different libraries like Hachoir, PdfMiner and others. With the results it will generate
a report with usernames, software versions and servers or machine names that will
help Penetration testers in the information gathering phase.”
In the syntax given, Metagoofil will search mattsBTshop.com for up to 50 results

between their TTL values to evaluate ports.
EC-Council added TCP Maimon back to the official courseware and obviously wants

A. Your IDLE scan results will not be useful to you.
B. The zombie system is a honeypot.
C. There is a misbehaving firewall between you and the zombie machine.
D. This is an expected result during an IDLE scan.","A. An IDLE scan makes use of a zombie machine and IP’s knack for incrementingfragment identifiers (IPIDs). However, it is absolutely essential the zombie remainidle to all other traffic during the scan. The attacker will send packets to the target
with the (spoofed) source address of the zombie. If the port is open, the target will
respond to the SYN packet with a SYN/ACK, but this will be sent to the zombie. Thezombie system will then craft a RST packet in answer to the unsolicited SYN/ACK,
and the IPID will increase. If this occurs randomly, then it’s probable your zombie is
not in fact idle, and your results are moot. See, if it’s not idle, it’s going to increment
haphazardly because communications from the device will be shooting hither andyon with wild abandon. You’re banking on the fact the machine is quietly doing your

simple definition match; sometimes it’ll be some crazy Wireshark or tcpdump listing. In
this example, you see a cleaned-up traffic exchange showing packets from one host being
sent one after another to the second host, indicating a scan attempt. The packets have the
FIN, URG, and PSH flags all set, which tells you it’s an XMAS scan. If the destination
port is open, you won’t receive anything back; if it’s closed, you’ll see a RST/ACK. This
tells you port 4083 looks like it’s closed (see line four of the response). As an addendum,
did you know there are two reasons why it’s called an XMAS scan? The first is because it
lights up an IDS like a Christmas tree, and the second is because the flags themselves are
all lit. As an aside, you probably won’t see this much out in the real world because it just

exam. Per Microsoft, SC.exe retrieves and sets control information about services.
You can use SC.exe for testing and debugging service programs. Service properties
stored in the registry can be set to control how service applications are started at boot
time and run as background processes. SC.exe parameters can configure a specific
service, retrieve the current status of a service, as well as stop and start a service.
A sampling of uses for the sc command follows: • sc config Determines the status of a service at system startup as well as sets a
service to run automatically, manually, or not at all. • sc query Displays information about services, drivers, and types of both.
Without parameters, it returns a list of all running services and associated
information. To create a list of all services, use sc query state= all. • sc start Starts a service that is not running. • sc stop Stops a running service. • sc pause Pauses a service. • sc continue Resumes a paused service. • sc enumdepend Lists the services that cannot run unless the specified service is

A. The administrator is attempting a port scan.
B. The administrator is configuring IP masquerading.
C. The administrator is preparing to flood a switch.
D. The administrator is preparing a DoS attack.","B. Do you remember network address translation? It’s a neat little technology
that allows lots of internal hosts, using nonroutable private addressing, to access
the Internet by borrowing and using a single address (or a group of addresses)
managed by a router or other system. IP masquerading is much the same thing;
it’s just accomplished through a Linux host. In short, a Linux machine can act as
a NAT translator by employing proper routing configuration, using one NIC to
communicate with the internal network and one with the external network, and
enabling IP masquerading.
Looking over the man page for the command (one copy can be found at http://
ipset.netfilter.org/iptables.man.html), we see that iptables is an administration tool
for IPv4 packet filtering and NAT. Per the man page, “Iptables is used to set up,
maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several
different tables may be defined.” Each table contains a number of built-in chains
and may be enabled by iptables -t tablename -switch, where tablename is filter, nat,
mangle, raw, or security, and switch equates to the option you wish to enable. For

D. It puts a NIC into promiscuous mode for sniffing","B. Per Microsoft, regarding the nbtstat command: “Nbtstat is designed to help
troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution problems. When a network is functioning
normally, NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
It does this through several options for NetBIOS name resolution, including local
cache lookup, WINS server query, broadcast, LMHOSTS lookup, Hosts lookup,
and DNS server query. The nbtstat command removes and corrects preloaded entries
using a number of case-sensitive switches.” Syntax for the command includes the
following: • nbtstat - a <name> Performs a NetBIOS adapter status command on the
computer name specified by <name>. The adapter status command returns the
local NetBIOS name table for that computer as well as the MAC address of the
adapter card. • nbtstat -A <IP address> Performs the same function as the -a switch, but using
a target IP address rather than a name. • nbtstat - c Shows the contents of the NetBIOS name cache, which contains
NetBIOS-name-to-IP-address mappings. • nbtstat -n Displays the names that have been registered locally on the systemby NetBIOS applications such as the server and redirector. • nbtstat -r Displays the count of all NetBIOS names resolved by broadcast and
by querying a WINS server. • nbtstat -R Purges the name cache and reloads all #PRE entries from the
LMHOSTS file (#PRE entries are the LMHOSTS name entries that are preloadedinto the cache). • nbtstat -RR Sends name release packets to the WINS server and starts a refresh,
thus re-registering all names with the name server without a reboot being required. • nbtstat -S Lists current NetBIOS sessions and their status, including statistics."

(IPP). Both of these point to printing. A final note on this: In our modern world,
the definition of what constitutes a server and what does not is a blurred line. If your
printer allows Telnet access to a terminal, is it really just a printer? For that matter,
many printers actually work off of an embedded operating system. In other words,
in real-world testing, your printer may actually be a Linux OS server of sorts. Your
exam will stick with the academic memorization and evaluation of port numbers, but
things are much more entangled in the real world."

B. nmap -sO targetIPaddress
C. nmap -sS targetIPaddress
D. nmap -sT targetIPaddress","C. A half-open scan, as defined by this nmap command line, is the best option in
this case. The SYN scan was created with stealth in mind because the full-connect
scan was simply too noisy (or created more entries in an application-level logging
system, whichever your preference). As far as the real world is concerned, it’s a
fact that most IDSs can pick up a SYN scan just as easily as a full connect, but
if you go slow enough, both a SYN and a full connect can be almost invisible. Aconnect scan is indistinguishable from a real connection, whereas a SYN scan can
definitely be distinguishable. In other words, the full connect will look like any other
conversation—just bunches of them all at once—whereas a SYN scan will show a
lot of systems answering a conversation starter only to be met with rude silence. The
lesson is any scan can and probably will be seen in the real world by a monitoring
IDS; however, the slower you go and the better you characterize your target without
putting additional packets on the wire, the less chance you’ll have of being seen, all

192,"In which scanning method would an attacker send INIT chunks to targets and await
responses?
A. SCTP INIT scan
B. SCTP COOKIE ECHO scan
C. SCTP half-open scan
D. SCTP full-connect scan","A. This one requires a bit of background knowledge, so read on.
In October 2000, SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) became an IETF
Proposed Standard and was published as RFC 2960. It was originally designed
within the IETF Signaling Transport (SIGTRAN) working group to address TCP’s
shortcomings relating to telephony signaling over IP networks, and it has since
evolved into a general-purpose IETF transport protocol. SCTP provides a connectionoriented, reliable, full-duplex, congestion- and flow-controlled layer 4 channel;
however, unlike both TCP and UDP, SCTP offers new delivery options that better
match diverse applications’ needs.
Whereas you’re probably familiar with the three-way handshake of TCP, SCTP uses
a four-way handshake (you can read all the technical details at https://datatracker.ietf
.org/doc/html/rfc4960):
1. The client sends an INIT signal to the server to initiate an association.
2. On receipt of the INIT signal, the server sends an INIT-ACK response to the
client. This INIT-ACK signal also contains a “state cookie.” This cookie holds
an assortment of information, including a message authentication code (MAC),
a timestamp corresponding to the creation of the cookie, the life span of the state
cookie, and other information necessary to establish the connection.
3. On receipt of this INIT-ACK signal, the client sends a COOKIE-ECHO response,
which just echoes the state cookie.
4. The server verifies the state cookie’s authenticity and allocates the resources for
the association, sends a COOKIE-ACK response acknowledging the COOKIEECHO signal, and moves the association to the ESTABLISHED state.
Shutdown for SCTP is just as graceful:
1. The client sends a SHUTDOWN signal to the server.
2. The server responds by sending a SHUTDOWN-ACK acknowledgement.
3. The client then sends a SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE signal back to the server.
SCTP can also abruptly close, using an ABORT signal due to an error in the SCTPstack or at the request of the client. SCTP does not support half-open connections.
An SCTP INIT scan sends SCTP INIT “chunks” to targets and awaits responses.
If the response is INIT+ACK, the port is open; an ABORT response means the port
is closed."

D. The packet returned in answer to this SYN request will acknowledge the sequence
number by returning 10.
","A, D. Yes, it is true that port 80 traffic is generally HTTP; however, there are
two problems with this statement. The first is all that is happening here is anarbitrary connection to something on port 80. For all we know, it’s a listener, Telnet
connection, or anything at all. Second, assuming it’s actually an HTTP server, the
sequence described here would do nothing but make a connection—not necessarilytransfer anything. Sure, this is picky, but it’s the truth. Next, sequence numbers areacknowledged between systems during the three-way handshake by incrementingby 1. In this example, the source sent an opening sequence number of 10 to the
recipient. The recipient, in crafting the SYN/ACK response, will first acknowledgethe opening sequence number by incrementing it to 11. After this, it will add its ownsequence number to the packet (a random number it will pick) and send both off."
195,"Which TCP flag instructs the recipient to ignore buffering constraints and immediately
send all data?
A. URG
B. PSH
C. RST
D. BUF","B. This answer normally gets mixed up with the URG flag because we all read it as
“urgent.” However, just remember the key word with PSH is “buffering.” In TCP,
buffering is used to maintain a steady, harmonious flow of traffic. Every so often,
though, the buffer itself becomes a problem, slowing things down. A PSH flag tells
the recipient stack that the data should be pushed up to the receiving application
immediately."
196,"You receive a RST-ACK from a port during a SYN scan. What is the state of the port?
A. Open
B. Closed
C. Filtered
D. Unknown","B. Remember, a SYN scan occurs when you send a SYN packet to all open ports. If
the port is open, you’ll obviously get a SYN/ACK back. However, if the port is closed,
you’ll get a RST-ACK."

((tcp.flags == 0x02) || (tcp.flags == 0x12) ) ||

A. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
B. SYN, FIN, URG, and PSH
C. ACK, ACK, SYN, URG
D. SYN/ACK only","A. You’ll see bunches of Wireshark questions on your exam—it’s probably the subject
EC-Council loves the most regarding this chapter—and syntax will be the key toanswering all of them. For this particular question subject, remember Wireshark has
the ability to filter based on a hexadecimal numbering system assigned to TCP flags.
The assigned flag hex numbers are FIN = 1, SYN = 2, RST = 4, PSH = 8, ACK = 16,
and URG = 32. Putting these hex numbers together (for example, SYN + ACK = 12)
allows you to simplify a Wireshark filter. For example, tcp.flags == 0x2 looks for
SYN packets, tcp.flags == 0x16 looks for ACK packets, and tcp.flags == 0x12looks for both (the attacker here will see all SYN packets, all SYN/ACK packets,
and all ACK packets). In this example, the decimal numbers were used, just not in asimplified manner.
As far as the rest of Wireshark filtering syntax goes, there are a couple key points
to remember. First, be sure to remember it uses double “equals” signs (==) in the
expression (ip.addr = 10.10.10.0/24 won’t work, but ip addr == 10.10.10.0/24will). Next, know the difference between the definitions for “and” and “or.” An “and”in the filter means both expressions will be queried and displayed, but only if bothare true. (In other words, “Show me all packets containing this source address andheaded toward this destination IP. If it’s from this source but going somewhere else,
ignore it. If it’s headed to this destination but is not from this source, ignore it.”)
An “or” in the filter means either of the expressions can be true (that is, “Show me all
packets containing this source address and any packets going to this destination IP,
no matter the destination or source address, respectively, for the two”)."
199,"A target machine (with a MAC of 12:34:56:AB:CD:EF) is connected to a switch port.
An attacker (with a MAC of 78:91:00:ED:BC:A1) is attached to a separate port on the sameswitch with a packet capture running. There is no spanning of ports or port securityin place. Two packets leave the target machine. Message 1 has a destination MAC of
E1:22:BA:87:AC:12. Message 2 has a destination MAC of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Which of
the following statements is true regarding the messages being sent?","B. This question is all about how a switch works, with a little MAC knowledge thrown
in. Remember that switches are designed to filter unicast messages but to flood
multicast and broadcast messages (filtering goes to only one port, whereas flooding
sends to all). Broadcast MAC addresses in the frame are easy to spot—they’re
always all Fs, indicating all 48 bits turned on in the address. In this case, message 1
is a unicast address and went off to its destination, whereas message 2 is clearly a
broadcast message, which the switch will gladly flood to all ports, including the
attacker’s.
Other versions of this same question will center on the efforts an attacker can use to
see that packet. Should the attacker desire to see all messages, a MAC flood could
turn the switch into a hub, effectively flooding all packets to all ports. Another
option is to span a port (break into the configuration of the switch and tell it to send
all traffic destined for a specific port to that port and to the attacker’s). Lastly, port
stealing (a totally fun memorization term from EC-Council) allows an attacker to
take advantage of the race condition (where the switch is constantly updating MACaddress bindings for ports) during a MAC flood attempt to effectively steal a port andsniff all traffic aimed for the target machine."
200,"You have tapped into a network subnet of your target organization. You begin an attack
by learning all significant MAC addresses on the subnet. After some time, you decide to
intercept messages between two hosts. You send broadcast messages to Host A showing
your MAC address as belonging to Host B. What is being accomplished here?
A. ARP poisoning to allow you to see all messages from either host without interrupting
their communications process
B. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host A to Host B
C. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host B to Host A
D. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host A destined to any address
E. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host B destined to any address","B. ARP poisoning is a relatively simple way to place yourself as the “man in the
middle” and spy on traffic (by the way, be careful with the term man in the middle
because it usually refers to a position where you are not interrupting traffic). The
ARP cache is updated whenever your machine does a name lookup or when ARP (a broadcast protocol) receives an unsolicited message advertising a MAC-to-IPmatch. In this example, you’ve told Host A that you hold the MAC address for
Host B. Host A will update its cache, and when a message is being crafted by the
OS, it will happily put the spoofed address in its place. Just remember that ARPpoisoning is oftentimes noisy and may be easy to discover if port security is enabled:
depending on implementation, the port will lock (or amber in nerd terminology)
when an incorrect MAC tries to use it or when multiple broadcasts claiming different
MACs are seen. Additionally, watch out for denial-of-service side effects of
attempting ARP poisoning—you may well bring down a target without even tryingto, not to mention Host B is eventually going to find out it’s not receiving anythingfrom Host A. As a side note, detection of ARP poisoning can be done with a tool
called xARP (www.chrismc.de). "
201,"Your target subnet is protected by a firewalled DMZ. Reconnaissance shows the external
firewall passes some traffic from external to internal, but blocks most communications.

allowed, along with standard traffic such as DNS queries. Which of the following mayprovide a method to evade the firewall’s protection?
A. An ACK scan
B. Firewalking
C. False positive flooding
D. TCP over DNS","D. Of the choices provided, TCP over DNS is the only one that makes any sense.
TCP over DNS is exactly what it sounds like—sending TCP traffic that wouldotherwise use a different port number in packets using port 53. Because the firewall
usually allows DNS requests to pass, hiding traffic under port 53 is convenient andfairly easy. The whole thing does require a special DNS server and DNS client setup,
but the steps to pull it off aren’t rocket science. While TCP over DNS will allow youto evade the firewall and send traffic internally, it will not provide you instant access tomachines or anything like that—it simply allows you to send traffic unnoticed through a firewall. TCP over DNS tools include Iodine (http://code.kryo.se/iodine/), DNS
Tunnel (http://dnstunnel.de), and Netcross (https://sourceforge.net/projects/netcross).
Another very common option for passing traffic through a firewall is HTTP tunneling.
The same principle applies, except in HTTP tunneling you abuse port 80 instead of
port 53. HTTP tunneling tools include HTTPort (www.targeted.org), SuperNetwork
Tunnel (networktunnel.net), and HTTP-Tunnel (www.http-tunnel.com)."

network traffic, and placement obviously makes a huge difference. One common
implementation is to connect via a SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) port on a switch.
The configuration for a SPAN port ensures all traffic from a defined range of ports is
also sent to the SPAN port. This makes the best option for your NIDS tap, at least as
far as this question goes: in the real world, you would most likely set up a passive tap,
positioned in the correct location to see everything coming across the wire."

A. DHCP starvation
B. MAC flooding
C. Promiscuous mode
D. ARP spoofing","B, D. Switches filter all traffic—unless you tell them otherwise, make them behavedifferently, or the traffic is broadcast or multicast. If you can gain administrative
access to the IOS, you can tell it to behave otherwise by configuring a span port
(which sends copies of messages from all ports to yours). Legitimate span ports are
designed for things such as a network IDS. To make the switch behave differently(at least on older switches, because newer ones don’t allow this much anymore), sendmore MAC addresses to the switch than it can handle. This fills the CAM and turns
the switch, effectively, into a hub (sometimes called a fail open state). Using a tool
such as MacOF or Yersinia, you can send thousands and thousands of fake MACaddresses to the switch’s CAM table. ARP spoofing doesn’t really involve the switchmuch at all—it continues to act and filter traffic just as it was designed to do. The
only difference is you’ve lied to it by faking a MAC address on a connected port. The poor switch, believing those happy little ARP messages, will forward all packets
destined for that MAC address to you instead of the intended recipient. How fun!"

C. To discover the sniffer, configure the IDS to watch for NICs in promiscuous mode.
D. It is almost impossible to discover the sniffer on the network.","D. This question is more about active versus passive sniffing than anything else. I’mnot saying it’s impossible, because almost nothing is, but discovering a passive sniffer
on your network is very difficult. When a NIC is set to promiscuous mode, it just
blindly accepts any packet coming by and sends it up the layers for further processing
(which is what allows Wireshark and other sniffers to analyze the traffic). Because
sniffers are sitting there pulling traffic and not sending anything in order to get it,
they’re difficult to detect. Active sniffing is another thing altogether. If a machine is
ARP spoofing or MAC flooding in order to pull off sniffing, it’s much easier to spot it."

(Choose all that apply.)
A. Using ARPWALL

C. Using private VLANs

(http://sourceforge.net/projects/arpwall/). It gives an early warning when an ARPattack occurs and simply blocks the connection. Virtual LANs (VLANs) provide ameans to create multiple broadcast domains within a single network. Machines onthe same switch are in different networks, and their traffic is isolated. Since ARPworks on broadcast, this can help prevent large-scale ARP spoofing. Per courseware,
static ARP entries are a good idea and at least one way to fix ARP poisoning, since
no matter what is banging around out on the network, the system uses the static
mapping you configured. An IDS may also be helpful in spotting ARP shenanigans,
but it wouldn’t necessarily do anything about them."

C. Installing WinPcap
D. Installing libPcap

by comparing the MAC address of each frame against its own: if they match, it pulls
the frame in and works on it; if they don’t match, the frame is ignored. If you plug
a sniffer into a NIC that looks only at traffic designated for the machine you’re on,
you’ve kind of missed the point, wouldn’t you say? Promiscuous mode tells the NICto pull in everything. This allows you to see all those packets moving to and fro inside
your collision domain. WinPcap is a library that allows NICs on Windows machines
to operate in promiscuous mode."

the following best describes the actions of the NIDS?
A. False positives
B. False negatives
C. True positives
D. True negatives","B. When it comes to alerting systems, false negatives are much more concerning thanfalse positives. A false negative occurs when traffic and circumstances are in place
for an attack signature, but the IDS does not trigger an alert. In other words, if your
system is firing a lot of false negatives, the security staff may feel like they’re secure
when, in reality, they’re really under a successful attack. Keep in mind a false negative
is different from your IDS simply not seeing the traffic. For example, if you tell
your IDS to send an alert for Telnet traffic and it simply didn’t see those packets (for
whatever reason), that may be a false negative for exam purposes but in the real world is probably more of a configuration issue. A better example of a false negative in thereal world would be for the attacker to encrypt a portion of a payload so that the IDSdoesn’t recognize it as suspicious. In other words, the IDS sees the traffic, but it just
doesn’t recognize anything bad about it."

A. Active

D. Passive
E. Session","D. This is one of those weird CEH definitions that drive us all crazy on the exam.
Knowing the definition of passive versus active isn’t really going to make you a better
pen tester, but it may save you a question on the test. When it comes to sniffing,
if you are not injecting packets into the stream, it’s a passive exercise. Tools such as
Wireshark are passive in nature. A tool such as Ettercap, though, has built-in features
to trick switches into sending all traffic its way, and other sniffing hilarity. This type
of sniffing, where you use packet interjection to force a response, is active in nature.
As a quick aside here, for you real-world preppers out there, true passive sniffing witha laptop is pretty difficult to pull off. As soon as you attach a Windows machine, it’ll
start broadcasting all kinds of stuff (ARP and so on), which is, technically, puttingpackets on the wire. The real point is that passive sniffing is a mindset where you arenot intentionally putting packets on a wire"
211,"Which of the following are the best preventive measures to take against DHCP starvationattacks? (Choose two.)
A. Block all UDP port 67 and 68 traffic.
B. Enable DHCP snooping on the switch.
C. Use port security on the switch.
D. Configure DHCP filters on the switch.","B, C. DHCP starvation is a denial-of-service attack EC-Council somehow slipped
into the sniffing section. The attack is pretty straightforward: the attacker requests all
available DHCP addresses from the server, so legitimate users cannot pull an address
and connect or communicate with the network subnet. DHCP snooping on a Cisco
switch (using the ip dhcp snooping command) creates a whitelist of machines that
are allowed to pull a DHCP address. Anything attempting otherwise can be filtered.
Port security, while not necessarily directly related to the attack, can be a means of
defense as well. By limiting the number of MACs associated with a port, as well
as whitelisting which specific MACs can address it, you could certainly reduce an
attacker’s ability to drain all DHCP addresses.
As a side note, you may also see a question relating to how DHCP works in the first
place. An easy way to remember it all is with the acronym DORA: Discover, Offer,
Request, and Acknowledge. Additionally, packets in DHCPv6 have different names
than those of DHCPv4. DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST,

Wireshark considers certain friendly terms such as HTTP as simple placeholders
for the actual port. This means in Wireshark (at least as far as CEH is concerned),

can help you hide in the cover fire."
221,"A security administrator is attempting to “lock down” her network and blocks access
from internal to external on all external firewall ports except for TCP 80 and TCP 443.
An internal user wants to make use of other protocols to access services on remote systems
(FTP, as well as some nonstandard port numbers). Which of the following is the most
likely choice the user could attempt to communicate with the remote systems over the
protocol of her choice?
A. Use HTTP tunneling.
B. Send all traffic over UDP instead of TCP.
C. Crack the firewall and open the ports required for communication.
D. MAC flood the switch connected to the firewall.","A. If you happen to own CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth
Edition, the companion book to this practice exams tome, you’re undoubtedly aware
by now I harp on protocols not necessarily being tied to a given port number in the
real world. Sure, FTP is supposed to be on TCP port 21, SMTP is supposed to ride
on 25, and Telnet is supposed to be on 23, but the dirty little truth is they don’t have
to. An HTTP tunnel is a brilliant example of this. To the firewall and everyone else
watching, traffic from your machine is riding harmless little old port 80—nothing to
see here folks, just plain-old, regular HTTP traffic. But a peek inside that harmless
little tunnel shows you can run anything you want. Typically, you connect to an external
server over port 80, and it will unwrap and forward your other protocol traffic for you,
once you’ve gotten it past your pesky firewall."
222,"An ethical hacker is assigned to scan a server and wants to avoid IDS detection. She uses
a tactic wherein the TCP header is split into many packets, making it difficult to detect
what the packets are intended for. Which of the following best describes the technique
employed?
A. TCP scanning
B. IP fragment scanning
C. ACK scanning
D. Inverse TCP scanning","B. There are several methods to attempt evasion of an IDS, and an IP fragmentation
scan is but one of them. It works by splitting the original TCP header into multiple,
smaller packets. Each of those smaller packets, on its own, means a whole lot of
nothing to the IDS, but when reassembled at the destination can, for example, scan
traffic (which is this case here). This is not to say it’s always going to work—almost
nothing is foolproof—but I can almost guarantee you’ll see this particular evasion
technique on your exam somewhere."
223,"In Nmap, the http-methods script can be used to test for potentially risky HTTP options
supported by a target. Which of the following methods would be considered risky per
the script?
A. CONNECT
B. GET
C. POST
D. HEAD","A. The http-methods script usage syntax is nmap --script http-methods <target>, where <target> is the IP of the system you’re after. Per Nmap’s support pages
(https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html), this script “finds out what
options are supported by an HTTP server by sending an OPTIONS request and lists
potentially risky methods. It tests those methods not mentioned in the OPTIONSheaders individually and sees if they are implemented. Any output other than501/405 suggests that the method is not in the range 400 to 600. If the response
falls under that range then it is compared to the response from a randomly generatedmethod. In this script, ‘potentially risky’ methods are anything except GET, HEAD,
POST, and OPTIONS. If the script reports potentially risky methods, they may not
all be security risks, but you should check to make sure.” You can also use additional
parameters, such as url-path, to further hone your results. For example, output fromthe preceding syntax showing PUT as a risky method might look like this:
PORT STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open http syn-ack
| http-methods:
|_ Supported Methods: GET PUT HEAD POST OPTIONS
..... Quite obviously, there is a lot of information tested in this one question—and many,
many ways you might see it on the exam. The HTTP options themselves will showup somewhere, so knowing the difference, for example, between HTTP POST(submits data to be processed and is normally allowable) and HTTP PUT (allows aclient to upload new files on the web server, which normally shouldn’t be allowed)
will become very important to your success. According to OWASP, the followingoptions are important to know: • PUT This method allows a client to upload new files on the web server. Anattacker can exploit it by uploading malicious files (for example, an .asp file that
executes commands by invoking cmd.exe) or by simply using the victim’s server
as a file repository. • DELETE This method allows a client to delete a file on the web server. Anattacker can exploit it as a very simple and direct way to deface a website or tomount a DoS attack.
CONNECT This method could allow a client to use the web server as a proxy. • TRACE This method simply echoes back to the client whatever string has
been sent to the server, and it’s used mainly for debugging purposes. This method,
originally assumed harmless, can be used to mount an attack known as
cross-site tracing"
224,"Bob is notified of what appears to be a denial-of-service attack against a system in his

numbers of DNS responses for an IP resolution. Which of the following is the most
likely attack?
A. DNS amplification
B. DNS server hijacking
C. SSRF
D. Metasploit NOPS module","A. A DNS amplification attack is exactly what it sounds like: an attacker takes
advantage of recursive DNS to flood a target with DNS responses. Basically, the
bad guy sets up a botnet and, when ready to go, has the zombie systems send DNS
resolution requests as if they came from the target. DNS does what it’s supposed to
do, and the target is flooded with DNS responses."
225,"A web application developer wants to test a new application for security flaws. Which of
the following is a method of testing input variations by using randomly generated invalid
input in an attempt to crash the program?
A. Insploit
B. Finglonger
C. Metasplation
D. Fuzzing","D. Even if you didn’t know what “fuzzing” meant, you probably could’ve whittledthis down by eliminating the known wrong answers. Per OWASP (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing), “Fuzz testing or fuzzing is a Black Box software
testing technique, which basically consists in finding implementation bugs usingmalformed/semi-malformed data injection in an automated fashion.” In other words,
fuzzing sends tons of weird inputs into fields to see what the application will do.
As an aside, you would find fuzzing in the Verification phase of Microsoft’s SecurityDevelopment Lifecycle (SDL). The entire SDL consists of training, requirements,
design, implementation, verification, release, and response. As a quick aside, fuzzingisn’t necessarily a “random” process—it’s more an effort of controlled chaos."

A. &lt;script&gt;
B. &#40;script&#41;
C. &amp;script&amp;
D. &quot;script&quot;","A. Cross-site scripting generally relies on web pages not properly validating user
input, and HTML entities can be used to take the place of certain characters. In this
case, the less-than sign (<) and the greater-than sign (>) surround the word script.
Respectively, the appropriate HTML entities are &lt; and &gt; (the lt and gt shouldgive this away)."
227,"An attacker tricks a user into visiting a malicious website via a phishing e-mail. The
user clicks the e-mail link and visits the malicious website while maintaining an active,
authenticated session with his bank. The attacker, through the malicious website, theninstructs the user’s web browser to send requests to the bank website. Which of the
following best describes this attack?
A. CSPP
B. XSS
C. CSRF
D. Hidden form field","C. There are few guarantees in life, but here’s one: you will definitely be asked about
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) on your exam. A CSRF attack is exactly what’s
being described here—an attacker takes advantage of an open, active, authenticated
session between the victim and a trusted site, sending message requests to the
trusted site as if they are coming from the victim’s own browser. Usually this involves
phishing, or maybe an advertisement, but the principle is always the same. CSRF
attacks can be prevented by configuring random challenge tokens, which allow the
server to verify user requests.
As an aside, a similar attack is known as session fixation. The attacker logs into a
legitimate site, pulls a session ID, and then sends an e-mail with a link containing
the fixed session ID. When the user clicks it and logs in to the same legitimate site, the
hacker then logs in and runs with the user’s credentials."
228,"Which of the following is used by SOAP services to format information?
A. Unicode
B. HTML entities
C. NTFS
D. XML","D. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a protocol designed for exchanging
structured information within web services across multiple variant systems. In other
words, it’s a way for a program running in one kind of operating system (let’s say
Windows Server 2019 or 2020) to communicate with a program on another (such
as Linux). It uses HTTP and XML to exchange information and specifies how to
encode HTTP headers and XML files so that applications can talk to each other.
One great advantage to this is also a great detriment, security-wise: because HTTP
is generally allowed through most firewalls, applications using SOAP can generally
communicate at will throughout networks.
SOAP injection attacks allow you to inject malicious query strings (much like SQL
injection, as a matter of fact) that might give you the means to bypass authenticationand access databases behind the scenes. SOAP is compatible with HTTP and SMTP,
and messages are typically one-way in nature."
229,"A web application developer is discussing security flaws discovered in a new applicationprior to production release. He suggests to the team that they modify the software toensure users are not allowed to enter HTML as input into the application. Which of thefollowing is most likely the vulnerability the developer is attempting to mitigate against?
A. Cross-site scripting
B. Cross-site request forgery
C. Connection string parameter pollution
D. Phishing","A. XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a
web browser without proper validation or escaping. The basics of this attack revolvearound website design (or web application design on that site), dynamic content,
and invalidated input data. Usually when a web form pops up, the user inputs
something, and then some script dynamically changes the appearance or behavior
of the website based on what has been entered. XSS occurs when the bad guys takeadvantage of that scripting (Java, for instance) and have it perform something other
than the intended response. For example, suppose instead of entering what you’re
supposed to enter in a form field, you enter an actual script. The server then does
what it’s supposed to—it processes the code sent from an authorized user. The best
defense against this is proper design and good input validation before the app ever
sees production in the first place."
230,"The source code of software used by your client seems to have a large number of
gets() alongside sparsely used fgets(). What kind of attack is this software potentially
susceptible to?
A. SQL injection
B. Buffer overflow
C. Parameter tampering
D. Cookie manipulation","B. A buffer overflow is an attempt to write more data into an application’s prebuilt
buffer area in order to overwrite adjacent memory, execute code, or crash a system(application). By inputting more data than the buffer is allocated to hold, you may
be able to crash the application or machine or alter the application’s data pointers.
gets() is a common source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities because it reads a line
from standard input into a buffer until a terminating EOF is found. It performs no
check for buffer overrun and has been largely replaced by fgets(). Also, technically
speaking, there is oftentimes no length to check for—it just writes until it reaches a
termination point"
231,"Which of the following would be the best choice in the prevention of XSS?
A. Challenge tokens
B. Memory use controls
C. HttpOnly flag in cookies
D. Removing hidden form fields","C. In addition to input validation controls (always good for bunches of vulnerabilitymitigations), setting the HttpOnly flag in cookies can be used in mitigation against someXSS attacks. Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker interjects code into a web pageform field that does not have appropriate input validation configured. The HttpOnlycookie flag can stop any injected code from being accessible by a client-side script.
Per OWASP, if the HttpOnly flag is included in the HTTP response header, the
cookie cannot be accessed through client-side script. As a result, even if a cross-site
scripting flaw exists, and a user accidentally accesses a link that exploits this flaw, thebrowser (primarily Internet Explorer) will not reveal the cookie to a third party."

A. This is not an attack but a return of SSL handshakes.
B. An attacker appears to be using Unicode.
C. This appears to be a buffer overflow attempt.
D. This appears to be an XSS attempt.","B. Unicode is just another way to represent text, so why not use it to try to get past

233,"Which MSFconsole command allows you to connect to a host from within the console?
A. pivot
B. connect
C. get
D. route","B. Questions on Metasploit can be very generalized or—like this question—pretty
darn specific. MSFconsole, opened with the msfconsole command, is a common
method of interfacing with Metasploit. As put by Offensive Security, it provides an
“all-in-one” centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all of
the options available in the MSF, and it’s the only supported way to access most
of the features within Metasploit. Commands used in the interface are listed and
discussed pretty well on Offensive Security’s site (https://www.offensive-security.com/
metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/). The connect command acts like a
miniature netcat clone, supporting SSL, proxies, pivoting, and file sends. By issuing
the connect command with an IP address and port number, you can connect to a
remote host from within MSFconsole the same as you would with netcat or telnet.
In addition to MSFconsole, you should also know that the Metasploit architecture
holds five modules: Exploits, Payloads, Encoders, NOPS, and Auxiliary. Exploits
is the basic module, used to encapsulate (and configure behaviors for) an exploit.
Payloads establishes a communication channel between Metasploit and the target.
Auxiliary is used to run things like port scanning and fuzzing"
234,"Which character is your best option in testing for SQL injection vulnerability?
A. The @ symbol
B. A double dash
C. The + sign
D. A single quote","D. SQL injection is all about entering queries and commands into a form field
(or URL) to elicit a response, gain information, or manipulate data. On a web page,
many times entries into a form field are inserted into a SQL command. When you
enter your username and information into the fields and click the button, the SQL
command in the background might read something like this:
SELECT OrderID, FirstName, Lastname FROM Orders
In SQL, a single quote is used to indicate an upcoming character string. Once SQLsees that open quote, it starts parsing everything after it as string input. If there’s
no close quote, an error occurs because SQL doesn’t know what to do with the
submitted characters. If the web page is configured poorly, that error will return toyou and let you know it’s time to start injecting SQL commands."

A. SELECT * FROM Orders_Pend WHERE Location_City = Orlando';DROP TABLEOrders_Pend --
B. SELECT * FROM Orders_Pend WHERE 'Orlando';DROP_TABLE --
C. DROP TABLE Orders_Pend WHERE 'Orlando = 1' --
D. WHERE Location_City = Orlando'1 = 1': DROP_TABLE --","A. SQL queries usually read pretty straightforward, although they can get
complicated rather quickly. In this case, you’re telling the database, “Can you checkthe table Orders_Pend and see whether there’s a city called Orlando? Oh, by the way,
since you’re executing any command I send anyway, just go ahead and drop the tablecalled Orders_Pend while you’re at it.” The only thing missing from SQL queries is
a thank-you at the end. As an aside, you can easily restrict which SQL verbs any user
can make use of (through DDL and DMAL statements), and you should. Allowingall users to drop tables and the like is akin to making your standard user a domainadministrator; it’s a rather dumb idea!"

B. The site may be vulnerable to buffer overflow.
C. The site may be vulnerable to SQL injection.
D. The site may be vulnerable to a malware injection.","C. Once again, you will get a few “gimme” questions on the exam. The error message

237,"Which of the following is a standard method for web servers to pass a user’s request to anapplication and receive data back to forward to the user?
A. SSI
B. SSL
C. CGI
D. CSI","C. Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standardized method for transferring
information between a web server and an executable (a CGI script is designed toperform some task with the data). CGI is considered a server-side solution becauseprocessing is done on the web server and not the client. Because CGI scripts canrun essentially arbitrary commands on your system with the permissions of the webserver user and because they are almost always wrapped so that a script will executeas the owner of the script, they can be extremely dangerous if not carefully checked.
Additionally, all CGI scripts on the server will run as the same user, so they have
the potential to conflict (accidentally or deliberately) with other scripts (an attacker
could, for example, write a CGI script to destroy all other attached databases)."
238,"An attacker performs a SQL injection attack but receives nothing in return. She then
proceeds to send multiple SQL queries, soliciting TRUE or FALSE responses. Which
attack is being carried out?
A. Blind SQL injection
B. SQL denial of service
C. SQL code manipulation
D. SQL replay","A. Blind SQL injection is really kinda neat, even if you’re not a nerd. Sometimes a
security admin does just enough to frustrate efforts, and you don’t receive the error
messages or returned information you originally counted on. So, to pull out the
info you want, you start asking it (the SQL database) a lot of true-or-false questions.
For example, you could ask the database, “True or false—you have a table called
USERS?” If you get a TRUE, then you know the table name and can start asking
questions about it. For example, “Hey, database, got an entry in your USERS table
named admin?” (SELECT * from USERS where name='admin' and 1=1;#';).
Blind SQL injection is a long, laborious effort, but it can be done"

conjunction with the attack?
A. ;
B. : C. ‘ D. “ E. -- F. ~","A. CSPP (connection string parameter pollution) is another form of injection attack.
In many web applications, communications with back-end databases make use of the

you just change the communication string and see what happens: add a semicolon,
type in your request, and watch to see if it was successful."
240,"An attacker is attempting to elevate privileges on a machine by using Java or other functions,

A. Shell injection
B. File injection
C. SQL injection
D. URL injection","A. When it comes to web application attacks, there are many vectors and avenues totake. One of the more common is injecting something into an input string to exploit
poor code. EC-Council defines these attacks in many ways. Also known as commandinjection, shell injection is defined as an attempt to gain shell access using Java or
other functions. In short, the attacker will pass commands through a form input
(or other avenue) in order to elevate privileges and open a shell for further malicious

241,"An attacker is successful in using a cookie, stolen during an XSS attack, during an invalidsession on the server by forcing a web application to act on the cookie’s contents. How is
this possible?
A. A cookie can be replayed at any time, no matter the circumstances.
B. Encryption was accomplished at the Application layer, using a single key.
C. Authentication was accomplished using XML.
D. Encryption was accomplished at the Network layer.","B. Cookies can be used for many things. If you can grab all user cookies, you can seewhat they visited and sometimes even how long they’ve been there. Cookies can alsohold passwords—and because most people use the same password on multiple sites,
this can be a gold mine for the attacker. In this scenario, the cookie is being replayed by an attacker to gain access. If a single key is used in encryption, a replay attack is
possible, because cookie authentication is carried out at the Application layer. It is
for this reason some organizations require browsers to automatically delete cookies
on termination."
242,"HTML forms include several methods for transferring data back and forth. Inside a form,
which of the following encodes the input into the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)?
A. HEAD
B. PUT
C. GET
D. POST","C. An HTTP GET is a method for returning data from a form that “encodes” the
form data to the end of the URI (a character string that identifies a resource on the
web, such as a page of text, a video clip, an image, or an application). For example, if
you were to enter a credit card number in a form using GET, the resulting URL might
look something like https://somesite.com/creditcard.asp?c#=4013229567852219,
where the long number is obviously a credit card number just sitting there waiting for
anyone to use.
Generally speaking, a POST is “more secure” than a GET, although they both have
their uses. If you’re wondering when a GET should be used as opposed to a POST,
the answer has to do with a vocabulary lesson: defining the term idempotent. Thrownabout with HTTP GET, idempotent is a mathematical concept about an operation
property: if the operation can be performed without changing results, even if it
is run multiple times, it’s considered idempotent. Therefore, if the input return
is assured of having no lasting effect on the state of the form in total, then using
a GET is perfectly reasonable. Also, a GET can usually transfer only up to 8KB,
whereas a POST can usually handle up to 2GB. However, keep in mind it may wind
up including sensitive information in that URI. Suppose your form returns a credit
card number and a bad guy is logging URIs: if HTTP GET is in place, the attacker
may be able to derive the information. In short, users can manipulate both GETand POST, but GET is simply more visible because of its reliance on something that
browsers render to the screen in an editable field. A POST is meant for pushing data
directly, and a GET is used when the server is expected to pull something from the
data submitted in the URL."

A. The site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
B. The site is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
C. The site is vulnerable to buffer overflows.
D. The site is not vulnerable to SQL injection.","B. The URLs shown here are attempting to pass a SQL query through to see what

This would now be considered “blind” SQL injection because the actual error was not
returned to the attacker (instead, he got a generic page most likely configured by thedatabase administrator). As an aside, sometimes the attacker won’t receive the error
message or error page at all, but the site will be displayed differently—images out of
place, text messed up, and so on—which also indicates blind SQL may be in order"

246,"Which of the following is one of the most common methods for an attacker to exploit
the Shellshock vulnerability?
A. SSH brute force
B. CSRF
C. Form field entry manipulation
D. Through web servers utilizing CGI (Common Gateway Interface)","D. I would bet very large sums of cash you will see Shellshock on your exam—maybeeven a couple of times. Shellshock (also known as Bashdoor) exploits a feature in thebash shell designed to allow environmental variable setting configuration. Basically,
someone was playing around in bash back in 2014 and figured out they couldadd arbitrary commands to environmental variable configuration command-line
submissions. If an attacker input something like
env val='() [ :;}; echo BADCOMMAND' bash -c ""echo REALCOMMAND""on a vulnerable system, BADCOMMAND would be executed before the real command.
Per Symantec (www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shellshock-all-you-need-knowabout-bash-bug-vulnerability), “The most likely route of attack is through Webservers utilizing CGI (Common Gateway Interface), the widely used system for
generating dynamic Web content. An attacker can potentially use CGI to send a
malformed environment variable to a vulnerable Web server. Because the server uses
Bash to interpret the variable, it will also run any malicious command tacked on toit.” Other avenues for Shellshock exploitation include the following: • OpenSSH The “force command” function (where a fixed command is runwhen a user logs on, even if the user requested a different command) can be
exploited in Shellshock. • DHCP Some DHCP clients have the capability of passing commands to thebash shell—for example, during connection to a Wi-Fi network. This can be
exploited in Shellshock. • Qmail If bash is used to process e-mail messaging, the server processes external
input in a way that can be exploited in bash."

B. All web crawlers are prevented from indexing all pages on the site.
C. The Googlebot crawler is allowed to index pages starting with /tmp/.
D. The Googlebot crawler can access and index everything on the site except for pages
starting with /tmp/.","D. The robots.txt file was created to allow web designers to control index access to
their sites. There are a couple of things you need to know about this file—for your
exam and the real world. The first is, no matter what the robots.txt file says, attackers
using a crawler to index your site are going to ignore it anyway: it’s valid only for
“good-guy” crawlers. After that, the rest is easy: robots.txt is stored on the root, is
available to anyone (by design), and is read in order from top to bottom, much like
an ACL on a router. The format is simple: define the crawler (User-agent :name_
of_crawler), and then define what it does not have access to. Most robot.txt files will
make use of the * variable to signify all crawlers, but you can certainly get specific
with who is allowed in and what they can see.
In this example, from top to bottom, the Googlebot crawler is defined and restricted
from seeing /tmp/ pages—no other restrictions are listed. After that, all other crawlers
(User-agent: *) are restricted from seeing any page (Disallow: /). The last two lines
are truly irrelevant because the condition to ignore all pages has been read.
For additional information here, if you think about what a robots.txt file does, you
could consider it a pointer to pages you, as an attacker, really want to see. After all,
if the security person on the site didn’t want Google indexing it, useful information
probably resides there. On the flip side, a security-minded person may get a little

A. Kismet can be installed on Windows but not on Linux.
B. NetStumbler can be installed on Linux but not on Windows.
C. Kismet cannot monitor traffic on 802.11n networks.
D. NetStumbler cannot monitor traffic on 802.11n networks.","D. Not only is this question overly confusing and very tool specific, it’s pretty much
exactly the type of question you’ll see on your exam. Kismet and NetStumbler are
both wireless monitoring tools with detection and sniffing capabilities. NetStumbler
is Windows specific, whereas Kismet can be installed on virtually anything. Both do
a great job of monitoring 802.11a, b, and g networks, but NetStumbler can’t handle
802.11n. Kismet can even be used as an IDS for your wireless network!
One last fun fact to know in relation to this question—Kismet does a better job
of pulling management packets. A lot of wireless cards on Windows systems don’t
support monitor mode and have a difficult time pulling management and control
packets."
,"Which of the following use a 48-bit initialization vector? (Choose all that apply.)
A. WEP
B. WPA
C. WPA2
D. WEP2","B, C. One of the improvements from WEP to WPA involved extending the
initialization vector (IV) to 48 bits from 24 bits. While this may seem like a simple
doubling of options, you’ve got to remember each additional bit exponentially
increases the keyspace. An IV provides for confidentiality and integrity. Wireless
encryption algorithms use it to calculate an integrity check value (ICV), appending it
to the end of the data payload. The IV is then combined with a key to be input into
an algorithm (RC4 for WEP, AES for WPA2). Therefore, because the length of an IVdetermines the total number of potential random values that can possibly be created
for encryption purposes, doubling to 48 bits increased overall security. By itself, this
didn’t answer all security problems—it only meant it took a little longer to capture
enough IV packets to crack the code. However, combined with other steps, it did
provide for better security."

A. WEP uses shared-key encryption with TKIP.
B. WEP uses shared-key encryption with RC4.
C. WPA2 uses shared-key encryption with RC4.
D. WPA uses TKIP and AES encryption.","B, D. WEP uses a 24-bit initialization vector and RC4 to “encrypt” data
transmissions, although saying that makes me shake in disgust because it’s really a
misnomer. WEP was designed as basic encryption merely to simulate the “security”of being on a wired network—hence, the “Equivalent” part in Wired Equivalent
Privacy. It was never intended as true encryption protection. WPA was an
improvement on two fronts. First, the shared key portion of encryption was greatlyenhanced by the use of Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). In short, the keyused to encrypt data was made temporary in nature and is swapped out every 10,000packets or so. Additionally, WPA2 uses NIST-approved encryption with AES as thealgorithm of choice."
,"Which of the following would you recommend as a means to deny network access byunauthorized wireless devices to network assets?
A. Wireless access control list
B. Wireless jammer
C. Wireless analyzer
D. Wireless access point","A. Of the choices provided, the access control list is the only one that makes sense.
This is what exactly what an access control list is designed for: by making sure onlydevices that are authorized can connect, you ensure unauthorized devices cannot
connect (or at least take steps to avoid their connection). As a side note here, be
careful not to confuse a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) with the ACL.
A WIPS will monitor your traffic and, just like the better-known network intrusionprevention system, will take steps to prevent intrusion based on traffic analysis,
thresholds, and alerts. Lastly, on questions like this, the process of elimination canhelp you discern the answer pretty easily."

A. Unauthorized association
B. Honeyspot access point
C. Rogue access point
D. Jamming signal","B. Sometimes EC-Council creates and uses redundant terminology, so don’t blame
me for this insanely annoying jewel. In this case, Joe most likely connected to what
he thought was the legitimate McDonald’s free Wi-Fi while he was getting his morning
coffee and checked the accounts in question. However, an attacker in (or close to) the
restaurant had set up another wireless network using the same SSID as the restaurant’s.
This practice is known as the honeyspot attack."
,"An attacker is attempting to crack a WEP code to gain access to the network. After
enabling monitor mode on wlan0 and creating a monitoring interface (mon 0), she
types this command:
aireplay –ng -0 0 –a 0A:00:2B:40:70:80 –c mon0
What is she trying to accomplish?","B. Within 802.11 standards, there are several different management-type frames inuse: everything from a beacon and association request to a probe request. One of
these management frames is a deauthentication packet, which basically shuts off a
client from the network. The client then has to reconnect—and will do so quickly.
The idea behind this kind of activity is to generate lots of traffic to capture in order
to discern the WEP access code (from clients trying to reassociate to all the new ARPpackets that will come flying around, since many machines will dump their ARPcache after being shut off the network). Remember that the initialization vectors
within WEP are relatively short (24 bits) and are reused frequently, so any attempt tocrack the code requires, in general, around 15,000 or so packets. You can certainlygather these over time, but generating traffic can accomplish it much faster. One
final note on this must be brought up: this type of attack can just as easily result in adenial-of-service attack against hosts and the AP in question, so be careful."
,"Which wireless standard works at 54Mbps on a frequency range of 2.4GHz?
A. 802.11a
B. 802.11b
C. 802.11g
D. 802.11n","C. The 802.11 series of standards identifies a variety of wireless issues, such as the
order imposed on how clients communicate, rules for authentication, data transfer,
size of packets, how the messages are encoded into the signal, and so on. 802.11g
combines the advantages of both the “a” and “b” standards without as many of the
drawbacks. It’s fast (at 54Mbps), is backward compatible with 802.11b clients,
and doesn’t suffer from the coverage area restrictions 802.11a has to contend with.
Considering it operates in the 2.4GHz range, however, there may be some interference
issues to deal with. Not only is a plethora of competing networks blasting their signals
(sometimes on the same channel) near and around your network, but you also have to
consider Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, and even baby monitors that may cause
disruption (due to interference) of wireless signals. Also, microwave ovens happen to
run at 2.45GHz—right smack dab in the middle of the range."

“Kismet is an 802.11 layer 2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detectionsystem. Kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring
(rfmon) mode, and (with appropriate hardware) can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g,
and 802.11n traffic. Kismet also supports plugins which allow sniffing other media.”You might also see two other interesting notables about Kismet on your exam: First,
it works by channel hopping, attempting to discover as many networks as possible.
Second, it has the ability to sniff packets and save them to a log file, readable by
Wireshark or tcpdump."

You’ll need to gather a lot of packets usinganother toolset, but once you have them together, Aircrack does a wonderful jobcracking the key. One method Aircrack uses that you may see referenced on the exam is
KoreK implementation, which basically involves slicing bits out of packets and replacing them with guesses—the more this is done, the better the guessing and, eventually, the
faster the key is recovered. Other tools for cracking WEP include Cain (which can also

with one key throughout a session with a client and reusing it, as occurred in
WEP, Temporal Key Integrity Protocol changes the key out every 10,000 packets

way to gain useful information from clueless users on a target network. However,
be forewarned: security personnel can use multiple tools and techniques to discover
rogue APs. NetStumbler is one of the more popular, and useful, tools available. It’s
a great network discovery tool that can also be used to identify rogue access points,
network interference, and signal strength. Kismet, another popular tool, provides
many of the same features and is noted as a “passive” network discovery tool.
NetSurveyor is a free, easy-to-use Windows-based tool that provides many of the
same features as NetStumbler and Kismet and works with virtually every wireless
NIC in modern existence. A “professional” version of NetSurveyor is now available
(you get ten uses of it before you’re required to buy a license). Lastly, identifying a
rogue access point requires the security staff to have knowledge of every access point
owned—and its MAC. If it’s known there are ten APs in the network and suddenly
an 11th appears, that alone won’t help find and disable the bad one. It takes some
level of organization to find these things, and that plays into your hands as an ethical
hacker. The longer your evil twin is left sitting there, the better chance it will be
found, so keep it short and sweet."

,"What is the integrity check mechanism for WPA2?
A. CBC-MAC
B. CCMP
C. RC4
D. TKIP","A. If you’ve not done your reading and study, this one could be quite tricky.
WPA2 uses CCMP as its encryption protocol, and CCMP uses CBC-MAC for
authentication and integrity. Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol is an encryptionprotocol specifically designed for 802.11i wireless networking. CCMP uses
CBC-MAC for authentication and integrity. As for how it exactly provides for
integrity, the true technobabble answer is very long and confusing, but the short of
it is this: the message is encrypted with a block cipher, and the encryption of eachblock in the chain is dependent on the encryption value of the block in front of it. Inother words, if block 2 is altered in any way, then decryption of blocks 3, 4, and soon, becomes impossible. One final note on CCMP for your study and memorization:
CCMP is based on AES processing and uses a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size,
and ECC sometimes refers to it as AES-CCMP"

most likely reason for this is MAC filtering is enabled on the AP, which is restricting
access to only those machines the administrator wants connecting to the wireless

MAC spoofing isn’t just for the wireless world. The command would be slightly
different (wlan0 refers to a wireless NIC; eth0 would be an example of a wired port),

,"Charity visits a client business she has worked with multiple times. When she opens her
laptop, her wireless connection attempts to automatically connect to the network, namedBUSINESS1. Unbeknownst to her, an attacker has set up a cloned network with the
same details. As her connection begins, he sends and continues to resend the third step of connection handshake. After many iterations of this, the attacker gains enough decrypted
details to crack the encryption key. Which of the following best describes this attack?
A. Rogue AP
B. AP MAC spoofing
C. aLTEr
D. KRACK","D. Of the choices provided, KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) comes the closest
to fitting the bill. First, you should know that KRACK is largely defunct as an attack
nowadays—most modern systems protect against it, and it won’t work. However,
you’ll no doubt see a question about it, so let’s dive in.
KRACK works by exploiting the four-way handshake all WPA2 wireless networks
take part in. During this exchange, the wireless systems blasts out something called
an ANonce (a one-time, randomly generated number, more or less). The client receives it,
runs some calculation of its own, and responds with another randomly generated
SNonce. If everything looks okay, the wireless system sends the GTK (Group Temporal
Key), which is the encryption key the WPA2 system uses for broadcast and multicast
messages. If everything looks right the client connects, you’re off and running.
In a KRACK attack, the cloned system run by the bad guy keeps resending the third
part of the handshake to the client. Each time the client accepts the connection
request, a small piece of data is decrypted and, over several iterations, the encryption
key is cracked.
One last thing—KRACK needs proximity to work. In other words, assuming we go
back in time before OS patches were created to prevent the attack, you’d have to be
close to your target to set things up. There’s only so much reach a wireless system has,
and you’d have to be inside that range to even attempt KRACK."

to talk about. In this particular example, called the Sybil attack, a vehicle or device
creates the illusion of another identity (in this example, being in more than one place at
a time), causing congestion and the associated insanity that goes along with it. When it
comes to VANET (vehicular ad-hoc network), this could be particularly dangerous. Ona standard network, it can cause numerous DDoS problems."
,"Of the tools listed, which is the best choice for quickly discovering IP addresses of IoTdevices on your network?
A. IoTInspector
B. MultiPing
C. Z-Wave Sniffer
D. beSTORM","B. Many of the tools you already know about will work just as well in IoT land, andMultiPing (https://www.multiping.com/) is a good example. MultiPing has beenaround for a while and is a quick-and-dirty way to discover systems hanging out onyour network. Even those pesky IoT devices can be found using it. Is MultiPing theabsolute best way to discover your IoT devices? Probably not. Will it work quickly,
as described in this question? Absolutely."
,"In October 2016, a DDoS attack involving millions of IoT devices caused a disruption of
service to large numbers of users in North America and Europe. Which of the followingmalware was used in the attack?
A. WannaCry
B. Cryptolocker
C. Locky
D. Mirai","D. It’s hard to believe something as simple as a baby monitor can be leveraged as
an attack platform, but in the fall of 2016 that’s exactly what happened. The Mirai
malware, created to deliberately find IoT devices to infect, created a botnet of immense proportions. This was then leveraged in a series of distributed denial-ofservice attacks against systems operated by the DNS provider Dyn (since acquired by
Oracle). The attack caused major disruptions across North America and Europe and
serves as a lasting reminder that security for IoT is sorely lacking. As an interesting
aside, the original Mirai attack worked because it made use of something any firstyear college student in cybersecurity would be able to recognize as a dumb security
oversight—it used default credentials commonly used by a bunch of IoT devices."
,"Which of the following are valid countermeasures in the prevention of IoT hacking?
(Choose all that apply.)
A. Disable guest and demo accounts.
B. Enable lockout features for excessive login attempts.
C. Disable Telnet.
D. Implement patch management and ensure device firmware is up to date.","A, B, C, D. I was going to say that securing IoT is the same as securing everything
else, but that wouldn’t be wholly true. It’s not that the same countermeasures
shouldn’t be used—of course the same basic-level approach applies across the board.
Disabling unused services, ports, and built-in accounts, changing default passwords,
enabling lockout mechanisms, and making sure your patch levels are current are all
basic items of security note no matter what you’re talking about. It’s not the measures
themselves that make securing IoT so difficult—the rub is keeping up with them.
As discussed in the companion book, CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One ExamGuide, Fifth Edition, IoT is expanding by the day, and a semi-secured network today
might be blown wide open by the addition of someone’s BYOD Internet-enabled
underwear tomorrow (don’t laugh, it’s actually a thing now). Countermeasures for
securing IoT are the same as you’d see anywhere else, with a few additional CEH items
thrown in for good measure (for example, ECC recommends you monitor port 48101
well, since IoT malware has been known to spread using it). Questions regarding this
topic should be of the commonsense variety for you, so prepping for your exam in
this arena is relatively easy. However, in the real world, vigilance—unending, tiring,
monotonous, Sisyphus-level vigilance—is really going to be your only hope."
,"Within the Attify Zigbee Framework, which of the following is used to discover target
devices within range?
A. zbstumbler
B. zbdump
C. zbreplay
D. zbassoc/flood","A. Let’s play a little Q&A game, shall we? I’ll introduce you to a collection of tools,
presented by Attify in its Zigbee Framework, and then ask you to identify what eachdoes without you ever seeing the tool, based solely on the knowledge you have fromstudying the rest of your CEH material. Ready? Here we go: Identify zbstumbler.
Identify zbdump. Now identify zbreplay. See a pattern yet? These are all the same
names and functions you’ve seen in other toolsets, except these start with zb. In this
case, zbstumbler is a lot like NetStumbler, allowing you to ID devices within range.
Now, before anyone gets all preachy on me, I am not advising you to ignore the
framework and just memorize terms for an exam. Indeed, it’s quite the opposite—I want you to actually know how to use these tools so that when you pass your
exam, the certification will matter. Go grab the framework (https://github.com/
attify/Attify-Zigbee-Framework) and practice. Find a light bulb in your house
and attack it (you can watch someone do it here: https://www.youtube.com/

just use common sense."
,"Which of the following is an advanced hardware- and software-designed radio used for
security testing in IoT?
A. Fluke
B. Raspberry Pi
C. HackRF One
D. Alfa AWUS036NH","C. There are few certainties in life—the rising and setting of the sun every day,
lovebugs making life miserable for a couple months each year in the South, andever-increasing taxes on everything from income to gas. One you can add to your
list is HackRF One being on your CEH exam. This handy little piece of hardware
exploded onto the scene in a Kickstarter campaign in 2014. Its creator, Michael
Ossmann, called it Project Jawbone back then, and its open source nature attracted alot of attention. On the good side, information security folks saw a great tool to helpin testing their wireless offerings. On the bad side, hackers immediately saw a quickand-easy way to jam, disrupt, and hack IoT devices everywhere.
For the just under $300, you too can own a HackRF One device (https://
greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/). According to the website, HackRF One was
“designed to enable test and development of modern and next generation radiotechnologies...and is an open source hardware platform that can be used as a USBperipheral or programmed for stand-alone operation.” What’s really interesting (and quite humorous to me), however, is the very next statement: “HackRF One is test
equipment for RF systems. It has not been tested for compliance with regulations
governing transmission of radio signals. You are responsible for using your HackRF
One legally.”
HackRF One is capable of receiving and transmitting on a frequency range of 1 MHz
to 6 GHz, and it transmits and receives half-duplex. It has become a valuable and
prized hacking tool due to its ease of use. Just be careful, though. Remember, you are
responsible for its legal use."
,"Which of the following is a model widely used to describe internal communications
within industrial control system (ICS) networks?
A. Purdue model
B. IIOT
C. SCADA
D. PLC","A. The Purdue model, formerly called PERA (Purdue Enterprise Refence
Architecture), is simply a structural model for industrial control system (ICS)
networks that defines six distinct layers—with defined components and relevant
security controls for each.
Developed in the 1990s by the Purdue University Consortium for computerintegrated manufacturing, it was adopted by ISA-99 and shows the connections and
dependencies of main components within a typical ICS.
The model splits ICS architecture into two zones (OT and IT), divided by a DMZ.
Each zone is further divided by levels relevant to specific component and function: • Level 0 is the assets that send information to the programmable logic controllers
(PLCs), such as sensors, pumps, valves, and motors. Multiple types exist within
each (passive or active, analog or digital, and so on). • Level 1 includes the PLCs, remote terminal units (RTUs), and intelligent
electronic devices (IEDs). These are the assets that monitor Level 1 and send
commands to the assets. • Level 2 contains human-machine interfaces (HMIs) and SCADA software. These
monitor and manage overall processes within the system.
• Level 3 holds all the systems that provide information on management of
production workflows. • Level 4 includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other systems
for managing operations logistics. • Level 5 is the enterprise network itself."

Separation of duties is a provisionof all cloud computing types, but only one of the three takes care of everything. InSoftware as a Service (SaaS), the service provider delivers the entirety of the span of
responsibility. Everything from applications and data through middleware and OS,
all the way down to the networking itself, is provided by the service provisioner. For
comparison sake, in Platform as a Service (PaaS), the service provider takes care of
everything except the applications and data. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), theclient holds the applications, data, runtime, middleware, and OS, while the provider

A. NIST Cloud Architecture
B. FedRAMP
C. PCI DSS Cloud Special Interest Group
D. Cloud Security Alliance","B. EC-Council, at least as of this writing, doesn’t mention one single regulatory effort
in cloud computing at all, outside of NIST’s reference architecture, in their official
courseware. This does not mean you will not see any cloud computing regulatoryefforts on your exam. I’m willing to bet you’ll see more and more of them as time
goes on, and FedRAMP is the 800-pound gorilla of cloud computing regulatory
efforts you absolutely need to know about. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP; www
.fedramp.gov/) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach
to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products
and services. It not only provides an auditable framework for ensuring basic security
controls for any government cloud effort, but also offers weekly tips for security
and configuration and even has free training available on the site. FedRAMP is the
result of close collaboration with cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General
Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DoD),
National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the

intermediary for providing connectivity between the cloud and the subscriber?
A. Cloud provider
B. Cloud carrier
C. Cloud broker
D. Cloud auditor","B. I can guarantee you’ll see several questions from the cloud world on your exam,
and many of those questions will be simply identifying portions of “NIST CloudComputing Reference Architecture.” The cloud carrier is defined in the architectureas the organization with the responsibility of transferring the data—akin to the power
distributor for the electric grid. The cloud carrier is the intermediary for connectivityand transport between the subscriber and provider."
,"A company relies on a private cloud solution for most of its internal computing needs.
After expanding into more online retailing, it relies on a portion of a public cloud for
external sales and e-commerce offerings. Which of the following best describes the clouddeployment type in use?
A. Private
B. Public
C. Hybrid

,"Cloud computing would be best suited for which of the following businesses?
A. A medical practice
B. An established rural general sales store
C. A law enforcement agency
D. A Christmas supply store","D. Scenario questions like this will be peppered throughout your exam on multiple
topics, and cloud computing is no different. In this case, the Christmas supply
store is, by its very nature, seasonal. This means instead of a steady flow of business
and computing resources, it will need much more support during the last couple
months of the year than it would in, say, July. Cloud computing provides the elasticity
(another term you may see pop up) of adding or removing computing resources as
you need them, which could very well save the company money."
,"A software company has decided to build and test web applications in a cloud computing
environment. Which of the following cloud computing types best describes this effort?
A. IaaS
B. PaaS
C. SaaS
D. Community","B. This scenario is tailor-made for Platform as a Service (PaaS). Despite also being aname brand recognized mostly during Easter for coloring eggs, PaaS is geared towardsoftware development, as it provides a platform that allows subscribers to create
applications without building the infrastructure it would normally take to developand launch software. Hardware and software are hosted by the provider on its owninfrastructure, so customers do not have to install or build homegrown hardware andsoftware for development work. PaaS doesn’t usually replace an organization’s actual
infrastructure; instead, it just offers key services the organization may not have onsite."

A. Private cloud is operated solely for a single organization.
B. Public cloud makes use of virtualized servers.
C. Public cloud is operated over an intranet.
D. Private cloud makes use of virtualized servers.","C. Most of the time I deplore the “not” questions—they seem designed to tripcandidates up more than to test their knowledge—but virtually all certificationproviders make use of them often. In this case, a private cloud is, of course, operatedsolely for one organization, and virtualization is used in all cloud deployment models.

,"A company relies solely on Google Docs, Google Sheets, and other cloud-based provisions
for its office documentation software needs. Which of the following cloud computingtypes best describes this?
A. SaaS
B. PaaS
C. IaaS
D. Public","A. This scenario aptly describes Software as a Service. SaaS is a software distribution
model—the provider offers on-demand applications to subscribers over the Internet.
Google Docs and Google Sheets, where word processing and spreadsheet software
actions are provided online, are perfect examples. Microsoft is also big in the SaaS
game, and Office 365 is seemingly taking over for the traditional Microsoft Office
suite. Instead of installing it on your system or buying it preinstalled at Best Buy (or
whatever vendor you use), you can “rent” Office 365—get what you need for as long
as you need. Given that Office is the world’s leading office productivity software, it
shouldn’t come as a surprise that Office 365 is a big hit. The U.S. Air Force, for one

,"A subscriber purchases machine virtualization and hosting through Amazon EC2. Which
of the following cloud computing types does this describe?
A. IaaS
B. PaaS
C. SaaS
D. Hybrid","A. There are three types of cloud computing implementation: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
In the case of Amazon EC2, Infrastructure as a Service best matches the description.
IaaS basically provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. A thirdparty provider hosts infrastructure components, applications, and services on behalf
of its subscribers, with a hypervisor (such as VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, Xen, or
KVM) running the virtual machines as guests. Collections of hypervisors within the
cloud provider exponentially increase the virtualized resources available and provide
scalability of service to subscribers. As a result, IaaS is a good choice, not just for
day-to-day infrastructure service, but also for temporary or experimental workloads
that may change unexpectedly. IaaS subscribers typically pay on a per-use basis
(within a certain timeframe, for instance) or sometimes by the amount of virtual
machine space used."
,"Which of the following are true statements regarding containers and virtualization?
(Choose two.)
A. Virtualization runs multiple operating systems on a single physical system.
B. Virtualization leverages multiple physical systems to create virtual operating systems.
C. Containers are placed on a single physical system and OS.
D. Multiple containers require multiple operating systems on the host device.
E. Containers and virtual machines are the same thing.","A, C. I can virtually guarantee you’ll see comparisons of containers and virtual
machines on your exam, and because the wording in their definitions is so close,
it’s easy to get them confused. The main difference to keep in mind between the
two is that containers share the OS of the system they’re on, whereas VMs are their
own separate entities with their own OSs. Virtually speaking, think of a container
as a package and a VM as a complete system. A container holds all the components
necessary for an application to run, and it relies on the underlying OS to host. A VMis a complete virtual system, with its own operating system."
,"Which of the following attacks occurs during the translation of SOAP messages?
A. Wrapping attack
B. Cross-guest VM
C. Side channel
D. Session riding","A. Attacks aren’t necessarily specific to cloud computing, but EC-Council covers
wrapping attacks here, so we’ll follow suit. In a wrapping attack, the user sends a
request to the server, but the SOAP response is intercepted by the attacker. He thenduplicates the original message and sends it as if he is the user. In short, to pull this
off, you just intercept the response, change the data in the SOAP envelope, andreplay"
,"Which of the following is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which
application components provide services to other components via a communications
protocol, typically over a network?
A. API
B. SOA
C. EC2
D. IaaS","B. In service-oriented architecture (SOA), software is designed where each of the
individual components works and communicates with components on different
systems across the network. Each computer can run any of the services in the
software, and each individual component is built so that it can exchange informationwith any other service in the network, without interaction or the need to make
changes to the software. For example, someone might create an API that provides
access to a database, which then allows third-party vendors to create their own
applications to take advantage of it."
,"In “NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture,” which entity manages cloud
services and maintains the relationship between cloud providers and subscribers?
A. Cloud broker
B. Cloud auditor
C. Cloud carrier
D. Cloud consumer","A. “NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture” defines the cloud broker as the
entity that acts to manage the use, performance, and delivery of cloud services, as
well as the relationships between providers and subscribers. The broker “acts as the
intermediate between consumer and provider and will help consumers through the
complexity of cloud service offerings and may also create value-added cloud services
as well."""
,"Which of the following is not a benefit of virtualization?
A. It allows for more efficient backup, data protection, and disaster recovery.
B. It reduces system administration work.
C. It improves operational efficiency.
D. It locks individual hardware to each individual virtual machine.","D. Some of you may actually work with and in a cloud, and you may disagree with at
least one of the benefits listed here. However, while there may be differences betweenthe real world and your CEH exam, for your test you really need to know the benefits of
virtualization. The idea itself is great—run one or more operating systems simultaneouslyon the same physical box by virtualizing the hardware to each OS. Multiple companies
(such as VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, and Xen) provide the hypervisor (aka virtual
machine monitor, or VMM, which is an application or hardware that creates andruns virtual machines) that allows multiple OSs to share the same physical machine
hardware. Virtualizing your server can improve operational efficiency, provide for moreefficient backups, offer disaster recovery and data protection, and reduce administrativework. Additionally, virtualization may have a positive effect on ensuring control andcompliance throughout the network, as well as reduce overall costs."

A. Public
B. IaaS
C. Sole source
D. Private","D. In a private cloud model, the cloud is operated solely for a single organization(aka single-tenant environment) and is usually not a type of pay-as-you-go operation.
Private clouds are usually preferred by larger organizations because the hardware is
dedicated and security and compliance requirements can be more easily met.

,"Which of the following statements is true regarding cloud computing?
A. Security in the cloud is the responsibility of the provider only.
B. Security in the cloud is the responsibility of the consumer only.
C. Security in the cloud is the responsibility of both the consumer and the provider.
D. None of the above.","C. One of the biggest misconceptions about cloud computing seems to be where
the lines of responsibility are drawn. However, it should come as no surprise that
security is everyone’s responsibility, and that absolutely extends to the cloud. The
provider must protect the hardware, virtualization, VMs, and network connectivity.
The consumer must protect their virtual systems (OSs, applications, and data).
Sometimes this is a challenge in the real world. Where does your testing start and
end? If your entire system relies on a cloud provider to remain up and secure, can youtest all of it? And what happens if your resources are comingled somewhere inside all
that cloud secret sauce? Can you really trust they’re on top of things, security-wise?
Should you? Can you? And lastly, remember that whatever issues you had before
migrating to the cloud won’t magically disappear once you’ve migrated. In effect,
“you take your problems with you,” as my humble tech editor is known to say, so all
those app vulnerabilities, authentication problems, and other technical (and especially
administrative) problems are still yours to deal with, whether you’re in the cloud or not."

A. Side channel
B. VM flood
C. Session riding
D. Cybersquatting","A. The side-channel attack, also known as a cross-guest VM breach, occurs whenan attacker gets a virtual machine on the same host as the target. Through a varietyof means for taking advantage of vulnerabilities in some shared technologies, the
attacker then uses the shared physical resources to pilfer data. Providers can mitigatethese attacks by using an up-to-date hypervisor provision, implementing strong
virtual firewalls between guest OSs, and enforcing the use of encryption. Subscribers
can help by locking down (hardening) their OSs and using good coding in their
applications (especially when it comes to accessing resources such as memory). As afun aside, these types of attacks are categorized by people who actually pen test for aliving as a unicorn attack—since you’ll have as good a chance seeing a unicorn as youwill actually performing this attack"

to pay in order to regain control and to clear the virus. Which of the following best
describes this infection?
A. Spyware
B. Ransomware
C. Trojan
D. Adware","B. The name ransomware gives away its purpose: the malware infects your systemand then restricts access to your files and folders, demanding a ransom payment
to get control back. ECC lists five different ransomware families: Cryptorbit,
Cryptolocker, Cryptodefense, Cryptowall, and police-themed. Usually the online
payment involves bitcoin, but it can take other avenues. In any case, never pay off the
attacker—you’re only signing yourself up for future terror. Cleaning off ransomware
may involve booting into Safe Mode, or even using a system restore on Windows
systems. You may even get away with an external AV scan as a fix action, but be sure
to scrub the system for hidden files and folders the ransomware may have left behind.
Lastly, I can’t overstate enough the value of good, solid, dependable backups. Even if
you’re foolish enough to pay the ransom, there is no guarantee any of your files will

Which of thefollowing best describes the type of malware analysis Matty is performing?
A. Static
B. Dynamic
C. File fingerprinting
D. Code emulation","A. EC-Council defines two main types of malware analysis—static and dynamic.
In static analysis, the examiner never actually installs or executes the malware. It’s

,"Pen test team member Amy attempts to guess the ISN for a TCP session. Which attack is
she most likely carrying out?
A. XSS
B. Session splicing
C. Session hijacking
D. Multipartite attack","C.The idea behind session hijacking is fairly simple: the attacker waits for a session tobegin and, after all the pesky authentication gets done, jumps in to steal the session for
herself. In practice, it’s a little harder and more complicated than that, but the key to thewhole attack is in determining the initial sequence number (ISN) used for the session. TheISN is sent by the initiator of the session in the first step (SYN). This is acknowledged inthe second step of the handshake (SYN/ACK) by incrementing that ISN by 1, and thenanother ISN is generated by the recipient. This second number is acknowledged by theinitiator in the third step (ACK), and from there on out communication can occur. Per
EC-Council, the following steps describe the session hijack:
1. Sniff the traffic between the client and the server.
2. Monitor the traffic and predict the sequence numbering.
3. Desynchronize the session with the client

4. Predict the session token and take over the session.
5. Inject packets to the target server
For what it’s worth, pulling this attack off via EC-Council’s take on the whole matter
requires you to do some fairly significant traffic sniffing. And if you’re already positionedto sniff the traffic in the first place, wouldn’t the whole scenario possibly be a moot point?
You need to know it for the exam, but real-world application may be rare."

employs an effort that uses compression to reduce the file size of the malware. Which of
the following best describes this?
A. Crypter
B. Wrapper
C. Packer
D. Compressor","C. A packer uses compression to pack the malware executable into a smaller size.
Not only does this reduce the file size, but it serves to make the malware harder to
detect for some antivirus engines. While it can be compared to a ZIP file, there are
differences. For one example, the extraction occurs in memory and not on the disk.
But the primary difference between a packer and a general compression routine like
.zip is that a packer inflates/restores at runtime and on binary files (versus the more
generic compression offered by .zip)."

attackers) who have found a way into your systems and have stayed around for a
long time. APTs are a nightmare from an incident response (IR) position, as trackingdown the initial attack vector, how long they’ve been around, and how much they’vehad access to is next to impossible."
,"An attacker makes use of the Beacon implant on a target system to hijack a browser
session. Which of the following best describes this attack?
A. Man in the browser
B. Man in the middle
C. Man in the pivot
D. IE hijacking","A. Most have heard of session hijacking and man in the middle, but what about manin the browser? A man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack occurs when the hacker sends
a Trojan to intercept browser calls. The Trojan basically sits between the browser andlibraries, allowing a hacker to watch, and interact within, a browser session. Cobalt
Strike—created by Raphael Mudge—added this feature a couple years back. If youhave his Beacon (the name of his implant) on a box, you can “browser pivot” suchthat all of the target’s active sessions become your own. All of them. It effectively
sets up a local proxy port so you can point your browser to it, and it directs all your
requests through the Beacon on the target machine. Now you’re browsing in your
own browser as the target, without them even knowing it."
,"Claire’s Windows system at work begins displaying strange activity, and she places a call
to the IT staff. On investigation, it appears Claire’s system is infected with several viruses.
The IT staff removes the viruses by deleting several file and folder locations and using
an AV tool and then reconnects the machine to the network. Later in the day, Claire’s
system again displays strange activity and the IT staff is called once again. Which of the
following are likely causes of the reinfection? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Claire revisits a malicious website.
B. Claire opens her Microsoft Outlook e-mail client and newly received e-mail is loaded
to her local folder (.pst file).
C. Claire uses a system restore point to regain access to deleted files and folders.
D. Claire uses the organization’s backup application to restore files and folders.","A, C, D. Virus removal can be tricky, especially if nobody knows how and when
the virus got on the system in the first place. As a matter of fact, in many places I’ve
worked, discovering the source of the virus is as important as cleaning the systemin the first place. Cleaning a virus off the system usually involves scrubbing the
Microsoft registry, deleting files and folders (don’t forget to check for hidden ones),
and a host of other details and actions. Sometimes AV removal applications can help
with this process, but sometimes it’s an involved, manual process.
Even with tools to help in removal, administrators can’t afford to overlook systemrestore points, backups, and user behavior. If a virus is on a system during a systemrestore copy action, then any restoration of that point will reinstall the virus. The
same thing goes for data backups themselves—it should follow that an infected file
while being backed up will remain infected during the restore action. As for user
behavior, if the user is re-infected immediately following a specific website visit, or
after using a USB (or other removable media), at least you can pinpoint the source
and hopefully stop it from happening again."
,"In regard to Trojans, which of the following best describes a wrapper?
A. The legitimate file the Trojan is attached to
B. A program used to bind the Trojan to a legitimate file
C. A method of obfuscation using compression
D. A software tool that uses encryption and code manipulation to hide malware","B. Wrappers are programs that allow you to bind an executable of your choice (Trojan)
to an innocent file your target won’t mind opening. For example, you might use a
program such as EliteWrap to embed a backdoor application with a game file (.exe).
A user on your target machine then opens the latest game file (maybe to play a handof cards against the computer or to fling a bird at pyramids built by pigs) while your
backdoor is installing and sits there waiting for your use later. As an aside, many
wrappers themselves are considered malicious and will show up on any up-to-date
virus signature list."

A. Overt
B. Covert
C. Authentic
D. Imitation
E. Actual","A. This is another one of those easy, pure-definition questions you simply can’t
miss on your exam. Whether it’s inside a computer, between systems, or across the
Internet, any legitimate channel used for communications and data exchange is
known as an overt channel. And don’t let the inherit risk with any channel itself make
the decision for you—even if the channel itself is a risky endeavor, if it is being used
for its intended purpose, it’s still overt. For example, an IRC or a gaming link is still
an overt channel, so long as the applications making use of it are legitimate. Overt
channels are legitimate communication channels used by programs across a system or
a network, whereas covert channels are used to transport data in ways they were not
intended for."
,"In what layer of the OSI reference model is session hijacking carried out?
A. Data Link layer
B. Transport layer
C. Network layer
D. Physical layer","B. If you think about a session hijack, this makes sense. Authentication has already
occurred, so we know both computers have already found each other. Therefore,
the Physical, Data Link, and Network layers have already been eclipsed. And what
is being altered and played with in these hijacking attempts? Why, the sequence
numbers, of course, and sequencing occurs at the Transport layer. Now, for all
you real-world folks out there screaming that communications can be, and truly
are, hijacked at every level, let me caution your outrage with something I’ve said
repeatedly throughout this book: sometimes the exam and reality are two different
things, and if you want to pass the test, you’ll need to memorize this the way
EC-Council wants you to. Session hijacking is taught in CEH circles as a measure of
guessing sequence numbers, and that’s a Transport layer entity. In the real world, your
Physical layer interception of a target would result in access to everything above, but
on the exam just stick with “session hijacking = Transport layer.”"

B. Using a protocol in a way it is not intended to be used is an example of an overt channel.
C. All DoS and DDoS attacks are specific to TCP.
D. Fraggle is a TCP-based attack.","A. Sequence prediction attacks are specific to TCP because TCP uses sequence
numbers. Unlike the fire-and-forget method employed by UDP, TCP uses sequencenumbers and windowing to keep track of conversations. Sequence prediction is a
session hijacking procedure where the attacker guesses the next sequence number

,"Which denial-of-service attack involves using multiple intermediary and secondary
machines to contribute to the DoS effort?
A. SYN flood
B. DRDoS
C. Application-level flood
D. LOIC","B. A distributed reflection denial-of-service (DRDoS) attack is also known as a
“spoofed” attack and makes use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines.
The bad guy sends attack information to the intermediary machines, which, in turn,
send the messages out to the secondary machines. This makes tracking the real source
of the attack very difficult to determine (the investigators will see and react to the
secondaries, not the originator)."
,"Which of the following best describes malware that infects legitimate software using
existing vulnerabilities to carry out malicious activities?
A. Fileless malware
B. APT
C. Dynamic analysis
D. Ping of death","A. In reading about fileless malware, I came across a description that said it was also
known as “non-malware.” While that did elicit a chuckle from me, the real point in
it is very true: fileless malware isn’t necessarily like a virus or Trojan you can find,
examine, and block with an AV system. Fileless malware is an effort to leverage
existing vulnerabilities to get legitimate services on your system to carry out the bad
guy’s wishes. Residing in RAM, fileless malware injects code into all sorts of running
processes."
,"IPSec is an effective preventative measure against session hijacking. Which IPSec modeencrypts only the data payload?
A. Transport
B. Tunnel
C. Protected
D. Spoofed","A. IPSec is a wonderful encryption mechanism that can rather easily be set upbetween two endpoints or even across your entire subnet if you configure the hosts
appropriately. You won’t need to know all the bells and whistles with IPSec for the
exam (and thank goodness, because there’s a lot to write about), but you do needto know the basics. Transport mode does not affect the header of the packet at all
and encrypts only the payload. It’s typically used as a secured connection betweentwo endpoints, whereas Tunnel mode creates a VPN-like connection protecting theentire session. Additionally, Transport mode is compatible with conventional networkaddress translation (NAT)."

A. AH
B. IKE
C. OAKLEY
D. ESP","D. Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) is a member of the IPSec protocol suite,
and it provides data authentication (proving the data is actually from who it’s
supposed to be from) and confidentiality (by encrypting the data). In Transport
mode, ESP doesn’t provide integrity and authentication for the entirety of the packet,
but it does in Tunnel mode (excluding the outer IP header, of course)."
,"Which of the following statements best describes the comparison between spoofing and
session hijacking?
A. Spoofing and session hijacking are the same thing.
B. Spoofing interrupts a client’s communication, whereas hijacking does not.
C. Hijacking interrupts a client’s communication, whereas spoofing does not.
D. Hijacking emulates a foreign IP address, whereas spoofing refers to MAC addresses.","C. Hijacking and spoofing can sometimes be confused with each other, although they
really shouldn’t be. Spoofing refers to a process where the attacking machine pretends
to be something it is not. Whether by faking a MAC address or an IP address, the
idea is that other systems on the network will communicate with your machine
(that is, set up and tear down sessions) as if it’s the target system. Generally this is
used to benefit sniffing efforts. Hijacking is a totally different animal. In hijacking,
the attacker jumps into an already existing session, knocking the client out of it and
fooling the server into continuing the exchange. In many cases, the client will simply
reconnect to the server over a different session, with no one the wiser: the server isn’t
even aware of what happened, and the client simply connects again in a different
session. As an aside, EC-Council describes session hijacking as using these steps:
1. Sniff the traffic between the client and the server.
2. Monitor the traffic and predict the sequence numbering.
3. Desynchronize the session with the client.
4. Predict the session token and take over the session.
5. Inject packets to the target server."
,"Which of the following is an effective deterrent against TCP session hijacking?
A. Install and use an HIDS on the system.
B. Install and use Tripwire on the system.
C. Enforce good password policy.
D. Use unpredictable sequence numbers.","D. As noted already, session hijacking requires the attacker to guess the proper
upcoming sequence number(s) to pull off the attack, pushing the original client out
of the session. Using unpredictable session IDs (or, better stated in the real world,
using a modern operating system with less predictable sequence numbers) in the first
place protects against this. Other countermeasures for session hijacking are fairly
common sense: use encryption to protect the channel, limit incoming connections,
minimize remote access, and regenerate the session key after authentication is
complete. And, lastly, don’t forget user education: if the users don’t know any better,
they might not think twice about clicking past the security certificate warning or
reconnecting after being suddenly shut down."
,"Which of the following is a group of Internet computers set up to forward transmissions
to other computers on the Internet without the owner’s knowledge or permission?
A. Botnet
B. Zombie
C. Honeypot
D. DDoS","A. A botnet is a group of systems an attacker has control over, without the owner’s
knowledge or permission. Each zombie system in the network sends messages anddata transmissions for the botnet controller—everything from spam and e-mail toviruses and ads. Although they are probably best known for their roles in distributeddenial-of-service attacks, botnets can be used for a variety of activities. As an aside,
ECC maintains that botnets are most commonly controlled via IRC (Internet RelayChat), but in the real world they can be controlled by a host of methods."

binary code?
A. String searching
B. Dependency walking
C. File fingerprinting

A. Before the three-step handshake
B. During the three-step handshake
C. After the three-step handshake
D. After a FIN packet","C. This question should be an easy one for you, but it’s included here to reinforce
the point that you need to understand session hijacking steps well for the exam. Of
course, session hijacking should occur after the three-step handshake. As a matter of
fact, you’ll probably need to wait quite a bit after the three-step handshake so that
everything on the session can be set up—authentication and all that nonsense should
be taken care of before you jump in and take over."

Which of the following attacks is being described?
A. POODLE
B. FREAK
C. Heartbleed
D. DROWN","C. Back when it was discovered in March 2014, Heartbleed was described as the
worst vulnerability found (at least in terms of its potential impact) since commercial
traffic began to flow on the Internet. Heartbleed exploits a small feature in OpenSSLthat turned out to present a very big problem. OpenSSL uses a heartbeat during anopen session to verify that data was received correctly, and it does this by “echoing”
data back to the other system. Basically, one system tells the other, “I received what
you sent and it’s all good. Go ahead and send more.” In Heartbleed, an attacker sends
a single byte of data while telling the server it sent 64KB of data. The server will thensend back 64KB of random data from its memory. Items such as usernames andpasswords, private keys (which is exceptionally troubling, since future communicationcould be decrypted), cookies, and a host of other nifty bits of information could be
easily stolen."
,"Which of the following statements is true regarding digital signatures?
A. Digital signatures are issued once per user, to be used on all documents until they expire.
B. A digital signature is a plain hash of the document contents.
C. Digitals signatures are issued per file type, allowing each to be used on multiple files
until they expire.
D. A digital signature cannot be moved from one document to another.","D. If you know how a digital signature is created, this one is easy. The signature is
nothing more than a hash of the document contents—making sure the contents
don’t change between sender and receiver—encrypted with the sender’s private key.
By using the private key, anyone holding the sender’s public key (sent from the CA)
can decrypt said hash of document contents, ensuring the sender’s identity and

A. IP Security (IPSec)
B. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
C. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

e-mail security?
A. PGP
B. Keyczar
C. RSA
D. MD5","A. Even though it’s probably best known as an e-mail security protocol/application,
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) can be used for a variety of purposes. PGP is used for
encryption and decryption of messaging (including e-mail), data compression, digital

well as combines conventional and public key cryptography.
Don’t get this confused with S/MIME. Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

,"You’re describing a basic PKI system to a new member of the team. He asks how the public
key can be distributed within the system in an orderly, controlled fashion so that the users
can be sure of the sender’s identity. Which of the following would be your answer?
A. Digital signature
B. Hash value
C. Private key
D. Digital certificate
E. Nonrepudiation","D. This one is actually easy, yet it is confusing to a lot of folks. You have to remember
the goal of this little portion of a PKI system—how does one know this public key
really belongs to User Joe and not User Mike, and how can it be delivered safely to
everyone? A digital certificate is the answer because it contains the sender’s public key
and can be used to identify the sender. Because the CA provides the certificate and
key (public), the user can be certain the public key actually belongs to the intended
recipient. This simplifies distribution of keys as well, because users can go to a central
authority—a key store, if you will—instead of directly to each user in the organization.
Without central control and digital certificates, it would be a madhouse, with everyone
chucking public keys at one another with wild abandon. And PKI is no place for Mardi
Gras, my friend."
,"After TLS had largely replaced SSL for secure communications, many browsers retainedbackward compatibility to SSL 3.0. Which vulnerability takes advantage of the degradationof service down to SSL 3.0 in the TLS handshake?
A. Heartbleed
B. FREAK
C. DROWN
D. POODLE","D. POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) was discoveredby Google’s security team and announced to the public on October 14, 2014. This
time it was a case of backward compatibility being a problem. Many browsers wouldrevert to SSL 3.0 when a TLS connection was unavailable, and because TLS performs
a handshake effort designed to degrade service until something acceptable (that is,
a degraded encryption both sides can use) is found, if a hacker could jump in the
connection between client and server, he could interfere with these handshakes,
making them all fail. This would result in the client dropping all the way to SSL 3.0.
SSL 3.0 has a design flaw that allows the padding data at the end of a block cipher tobe changed so that the encryption cipher becomes less secure each time it is passed.
If the same secret—let’s say a password—is sent over several sessions, more and moreinformation about it will leak. Eventually the connection may as well be plain text,
and the attacker sitting in the middle can see everything. Mitigation for POODLE is
simple—don’t use SSL 3.0 anywhere."
,"Which mode of IPSec is most often chosen for internal communications?
A. AH
B. ESP
C. Tunnel

,"Hope works on a security team, and her laptop contains many confidential files. Which of
the following is the best choice for protection of those files from loss or theft of the laptop?
A. Set a BIOS password.
B. Create hidden folders to store the files in.
C. Password-protect the files.
D. Install full disk encryption.","D. Full disk encryption (FDE), otherwise known as data-at-rest protection, is
designed explicitly for this purpose. In an enterprise-level system, each laptop (or
other portable system) disk is encrypted and assigned a password (PIN) only the
owner knows and a means to generate and use a recovery key. At boot, the owner
enters the key and the disk is unlocked for use. If the password is forgotten, the
recovery key can be generated and used to unlock the drive. This protects the data
from loss or theft of the system itself."
,"Which of the following statements is not true regarding steganography?
A. Steganography can use least significant bit insertion, masking, and filtering as
techniques to hide messaging.
B. Steganography only works on color images.
C. Image files embedded with steganography may be larger in size and display strangecolor palettes.
D. Character positioning, text patterns, unusual blank spaces, and language anomalies
can all be symptoms of a text file embedded with steganography","B. Steganography is the practice of concealing a message inside another medium(such as another file or an image) in such a way that only the sender and recipient
even know of its existence, let alone the manner in which to decipher it. It can be as
simple as hiding the message in the text of a written correspondence or as complexas changing bits within a huge media file to carry a message. Steganography can beembedded in color or grayscale images, text files, audio files, and even in video. Ingrayscale images, steganography is usually implemented via masking (also known as
filtering, which hides the data in much the same way as a watermark on a document)."
,"An SSL session requires a client and a server to pass information between each other via a
handshake and to agree on a secured channel. Which of the following best describes the
session key creation during the setup of an SSL session?
A. The server creates the key after verifying the client’s identity.
B. The server creates the key immediately on the client connection.
C. The client creates the key using the server’s public key.
D. The client creates the key after verifying the server’s identity.","D. In the CEH world, SSL has six major steps (others claim seven or more, but we’re
studying for the CEH certification here, so we’ll stick with theirs). The six steps
are (1) client hello, (2) server hello and certificate, (3) server hello done message,
(4) client verifies server identity and sends Client Key Exchange message, (5) client
sends Change Cipher Spec and Finish message, and (6) server responds with Change
Cipher Spec and Finish message. The session key is created by the client after it
verifies the server’s identity (using the certificate provided in step 2)."
,"Which encryption algorithm uses variable block sizes (from 32 to 128 bits)?
A. SHA-1
B. RC5
C. 3DES
D. AES","B. Questions on identifying encryption algorithms really come down to memorizationof some key terms. Rivest Cipher (RC) encompasses several versions, from RC2
through RC6. It is an asymmetric block cipher that uses a variable key length up to
2040 bits. RC6, the latest version, uses 128-bit blocks, whereas RC5 uses a variable
block size (32, 64, or 128)."
,"Which hash algorithm was developed by the NSA and produces output values up to512 bits?
A. MD5
B. SHA-1
C. SHA-2
D. SSL","C. Both SHA-1 and SHA-2 were developed by the NSA; however, SHA-1 producedonly a 160-bit output value. SHA-2 was developed to rectify the shortcomings of
its predecessor and is capable of producing outputs of 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits.
Although it was designed as a replacement for SHA-1 (which was supposed to havebeen phased out in 2010), SHA-2 is still not as widely used. As an aside, SHA-3 canproduce 512-bit keys as well."
,"You are concerned about protecting data on your organization’s laptops from loss or theft.
Which of the following technologies best accomplishes this goal?
A. Single sign-on
B. Cloud computing
C. IPSec Tunnel mode
D. Full disk encryption","D. Data-at-rest (DAR) protection is a security technology tailor-made for loss andtheft protection, with one tiny little catch: full disk encryption in DAR sets up a
preboot session that requires valid credentials to unlock the machine. However, it’s
important to note the preboot session will only engage after a full system power
down. If the user just closes the lid and puts the machine into sleep mode, DARprotection does nothing. Assuming the user does power off the machine before takingit on a trip, preboot protects everything—including the Master Boot Record—andensures that even if the laptop is stolen or lost, the data inside is protected. If the user
doesn’t power off, then DAR is just another security tool that provides the illusion of
security—which may be even worse than having nothing at all."
,"In a discussion on symmetric encryption, a friend mentions that one of the drawbacks
with this system is scalability. He goes on to say that for every person you add to the mix,
the number of keys increases dramatically. If seven people are in a symmetric encryption
pool, how many keys are necessary?
A. 7
B. 14
C. 21
D. 28","C. Symmetric encryption is really fast and works great with bulk encryption;
however, scalability and key exchange are huge drawbacks. To determine the
number of keys you need, use the formula N(N – 1)/2. Plugging 7 into this, we
have 7(7 – 1)/2 = 21."
,"Which of the following is a true statement?
A. Symmetric encryption scales easily and provides for nonrepudiation.
B. Symmetric encryption does not scale easily and does not provide for nonrepudiation.
C. Symmetric encryption is not suited for bulk encryption.
D. Symmetric encryption is slower than asymmetric encryption.","B. Symmetric encryption has always been known for strength and speed; however,
scalability and key exchange are big drawbacks. Additionally, there is no way
to provide for nonrepudiation (within the confines of the encryption system).
Symmetric encryption is good for a great many things when you don’t want all the
overhead of key management."

,"Bit streams are run through an XOR operation. Which of the following is a true statement
for each bit pair regarding this function?
A. If the first value is 0 and the second value is 1, then the output is 0.
B. If the first value is 1 and the second value is 0, then the output is 0.
C. If the first value is 0 and the second value is 0, then the output is 1.
D. If the first value is 1 and the second value is 1, then the output is 0.","D. An XOR operation requires two inputs, and in the case of encryption algorithms,
this would be the data bits and the key bits. Each bit is fed into the operation—one
from the data, the next from the key—and then XOR makes a determination: if the
bits match, the output is 0; if they don’t, it’s 1."
,"Which of the following attacks attempts to re-send a portion of a cryptographic exchangein hopes of setting up a communications channel?
A. Known plain text
B. Chosen plain text
C. Man in the middle
D. Replay","D. Replay attacks are most often performed within the context of a man-in-themiddle attack and not necessarily just for communications channel setup. They’re
also used for DoS attacks against a system, to feed bad data in hopes of corrupting asystem, to try to overflow a buffer (send more encrypted data than expected), and soon. The hacker repeats a portion of a cryptographic exchange in hopes of fooling thesystem into setting up a communications channel. The attacker doesn’t really have toknow the actual data (such as the password) being exchanged; he just has to get thetiming right in copying and then replaying the bit stream.

nonrepudiation feature we’re looking for. This is the only instance on the exam where
the private key is used for encryption. In general, public encrypts, and private decrypts.
The steps for creating an encrypted message with a digital signature are as follows:
1. Create a hash of the body of the message.
2. Encrypt that hash with your private key (adding it to the message as your signature).
3. Encrypt the entire message with the public key of the recipient."
,"A systems administrator is applying digital certificates for authentication and verification

Keychain and uses the public key to sign documents that are used throughout the
network. Which of the following certificate types is in use?
A. Public
B. Private
C. Signed
D. Self-signed","D. Security certificates have many uses in networking: for example, applications
and network services might use them for authentication. If you are doing business
across the Internet, your clients will want to ensure a trusted third party signs your
certificates, so they can verify you are indeed legitimate. Internally, though, due to
cost and speed of deployment/maintenance, self-signed certificates are the way to go.
A self-signed certificate is simply one that is signed by the same entity that created
it. Because most of your internal certificate needs can be served without going to an
external CA to verify identity, using self-signed certificates may be the best bet."
,"While observing a target organization’s building, you note the lone entrance has a guardposted just inside the door. After entering the external door, you note the lobby of the
building is separated from the external door by a small glass-paneled room, with a closeddoor facing the exterior and a closed door to the interior. There appears to be an RFIDscanning device and a small keyboard with video display in the room. Which of the
following best defines this physical security control?
A. Guard shack
B. Turnstile
C. Man shack
D. Man trap","D. If you took a test on college football history, you know it would contain a
question about Alabama. If you took one on trumpet players, there’d be one about
Dizzy Gillespie. And if you take a test on physical security measures for CertifiedEthical Hacker, you’re going to be asked about the man trap.
A man trap is nothing more than a locked space you can hold someone in while
verifying their right to proceed into the secured area. It’s usually a glass (or clear
plastic) walled room that locks the exterior door as soon as the person enters. Thenthere is some sort of authentication mechanism, such as a smartcard with a PIN or abiometric system. Assuming the authentication is successful, the second door leadingto the interior of the building will unlock, and the person is allowed to proceed. If
it’s not successful, the doors will remain locked until the guard can check things out.
As an aside, in addition to authentication, some man traps add other checks, such as
measuring the person’s weight to see if they’ve mysteriously gained or lost 20 pounds
since Friday.
A few other notes here may be of use to you: First, I’ve seen a man trap defined as
either manual or automatic, where manual has a guard locking and unlocking the
doors and automatic has the locks tied to the authentication system, as describedpreviously. Second, a man trap is also referred to in some definitions as an air lock.
Should you see that term on the exam, know that it is referring to the man trap.
Third, man traps in the real world can sometimes come in the form of a rotatingdoor or turnstile, locking partway around if the person doesn’t authenticate properly.
And, on some of the really fancy ones, sensors will lock the man trap if two people
are trying to get through at the same time.
And, finally, one last note of importance—a man trap is also defined or known as anaccess control vestibule. Just rolls right off the tongue, doesn’t it?"
,"In your social engineering efforts, you call the company help desk and pose as a user who
has forgotten a password. You ask the technician to help you reset your password, which
she happily complies with. Which social engineering attack is in use here?
A. Piggybacking
B. Reverse social engineering
C. Technical support
D. Halo effect","C. Although it may seem silly to label social engineering attacks (because many
of them contain the same steps and bleed over into one another), you’ll need to
memorize them for your exam. A technical support attack is one in which the
attacker calls the support desk in an effort to gain a password reset or other useful
information. This is a valuable method because if you get the right help desk person
(that is, someone susceptible to a smooth-talking social engineer), you can get the
keys to the kingdom."
,"Which of the following is a true statement regarding biometric systems?
A. The lower the CER, the better the biometric system.
B. The higher the CER, the better the biometric system.
C. The higher the FRR, the better the biometric system.
D. The higher the FAR, the better the biometric system.","A. The crossover error rate (CER) is the point on a chart where the false acceptancerate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) meet, and the lower the number, the better
the system. It’s a means by which biometric systems are calibrated—getting the FARand FRR the same. All that said, though, keep in mind that in certain circumstances
a client may be more interested in a lower FAR than FRR, or vice versa, and thereforethe CER isn’t as much a concern. For example, a bank may be far more interestedin preventing false acceptance than it is in preventing false rejection. In other words,
so what if a user is upset they can’t log on, so long as their money is safe from a falseacceptance?"
,"A pen tester sends an unsolicited e-mail to several users in the target organization. The
e-mail is well crafted and appears to be from the company’s help desk, advising users
of potential network problems. The e-mail provides a contact number to call in the
event a user is adversely affected. The pen tester then performs a denial of service onseveral systems and receives phone calls from users asking for assistance. Which social
engineering practice is in play here?
A. Technical support
B. Impersonation
C. Phishing
D. Reverse social engineering","D. This may turn out to be a somewhat confusing question for some folks, but
it’s actually pretty easy. Reverse social engineering involves three steps. First, in the
marketing phase, an attacker advertises himself as a technical point of contact for
problems that may be occurring soon. Second, in the sabotage phase, the attacker
performs a denial of service or other attack on the user. Third, in the tech support
phase, the user calls the attacker and freely hands over information, thinking they arebeing assisted by the company’s technical support team.
As an aside, there are two things to remember about employing this social engineeringpractice in the real world. First, be sure to market to the appropriate audience:
attempting this against IT staff probably won’t work as well as the “average” user andmay get you caught. Second, and perhaps more important, you’ll need to remember
that the more lies you tell, the more things you have to make true. Complexity is risky, and reverse social engineering involves a lot of complexity. It’s best used in special
cases, and then only if you can’t find something else to do."

A. Eavesdropping
B. Tailgating
C. Shoulder surfing
D. Piggybacking","C. This one is so easy I hope you maintain your composure and stifle the urge to
whoop and yell in the test room. Shoulder surfing doesn’t necessarily require you to
actually be on the victim’s shoulder—you just have to be able to watch their onscreenactivity. I once shoulder surfed in front of someone (a mirror behind her showed her
screen clear as day). You don’t even really need to be close to the victim—there are
plenty of optics that can zoom in a field of vision from a very long distance away.
As an aside, in the real world, if you are close enough to see someone’s screen, you’re
probably close enough to listen to them as well. EC-Council puts the emphasis of
shoulder surfing on the visual aspect—eavesdropping would be auditory"
,"A recent incident investigated by the local IR team involved a user receiving an e-mail
that appeared to be from the U.S. Postal Service, notifying her of a package headed her
way and providing a link for tracking the package. The link provided took the user towhat appeared to be the USPS site, where she input her user information to learn about
the latest shipment being delivered. Which attack did the user fall victim to?
A. Phishing
B. Internet level
C. Reverse social engineering
D. Impersonation","A. Phishing is one of the most pervasive and effective social engineering attacks onthe planet. It’s successful because crafting a legitimate-looking e-mail that links a user
to an illegitimate site or malware package is easy to do. What’s more, the e-mail is
easy to spread, and it preys on our human nature to trust. If the source of the e-mail
looks legitimate or the layout looks legitimate, most people will click away without
even thinking about it. Phishing e-mails can often include pictures lifted directly off
the legitimate website and use creative means of spelling that aren’t easy to spot: www.regions.com is a legitimate bank website that could be spelled in a phishing e-mail as
www.regi0ns.com.
When it comes to real-world use of phishing by ethical hackers and pen testers,
there are a couple items of note: First, phishing has an extreme liability aspect to it
when spoofing a legitimate business. If you’re pen testing an organization and phishusing a variant of a real business name, you could be opening yourself up to some
serious costs: the first time someone calls the real Regions bank to complain is the
moment that the attacker just became liable for the costs associated with the attack.
Second is the risk involved with people simply forwarding your phishing attempt
to recipients you never intended, allowing it to take on a life of its own. In short,
the pen tester will certainly limit the bait (malware or website link embedded inthe phishing attempt), but they will have no control over what a user decides to dowith the e-mail. Suppose the pen tester doesn’t know the exact IP range or makes asimple mistake in the configuration of the malware, and a user sends it home. Or
to a banking friend. Or to the FBI. Or to a friend who works on a DoD system.
Now you’ve not only hooked the wrong fish but maybe infected something in the
government. That’s nothing to joke about, and it may be a lot worse than a simple
mistake. The bottom line is, in the real world, phishing is dangerous if not plannedand implemented almost perfectly, and pen test teams need to use extreme cautionin implementing it"
,"Which type of social engineering attack uses phishing, pop-ups, and IRC channels?
A. Technical
B. Computer based
C. Human based
D. Physica","B. All social engineering attacks fall into one of two categories: human based or
computer based. Computer-based attacks are those carried out with the use of a
computer or other data-processing device. Some examples are fake pop-up windows,
SMS texts, e-mails, and chat rooms or services. Social media sites (such as Facebook
and LinkedIn) are consistent examples as well, and spoofing entire websites isn’t out
of the realm of possibility here either."

,"Which of the following constitutes the highest risk to the organization?
A. Black-hat hacker
B. White-hat hacker
C. Gray-hat hacker
D. Disgruntled employee","D. When we consider security measures, most of our attention is usually aimedoutside the company, because that’s where all the bad guys are, right? Unfortunately,
this line of thinking leads to all sorts of exposure, for many reasons, and it’s more
common than you might think. A disgruntled employee is still an employee, after all,
which leads to the main reason they’re so dangerous: location. They are already insidethe network. Inside attacks are generally easier to launch, are more successful, and areharder to prevent. When you add the human element of having an axe to grind, this
can boil over quickly—whether or not the employee has the technical knowledge topull off the attack. The idea that someone wanting to do harm to our organization’s
network not only already has the access to do so but has it because we gave it to themand we’re not watching them should be frightening to us all."

involves following someone through an open door or gate just like piggybacking does;
however, in tailgating, a fake identification badge of some sort is used. As an aside, if
your exam question does not include both terms—tailgating and piggybacking—but
the effort is the same (an attacker following a badged employee through a gate or
door), you won’t have to choose between them. Usually, in this case, tailgating will beused more frequently than piggybacking"

D. User education and training
E. Strong firewall configuration","A, B, D. ECC identifies several countermeasures against social engineering, but
in the real world, none of them (by themselves or grouped) is really the key. The

totally out of your control. Sure, you can draft strong policy requiring users to
comply with security measures, implement guidelines on everything imaginable toreduce risks and streamline efficiency, and hold educational briefings and trainingsessions for each and every user in your organization, but when it comes down to it,it’s the user who has to do the right thing.

,"Which of the following are indicators of a phishing e-mail? (Choose all that apply.)
A. It does not reference you by name.
B. It contains misspelled words or grammatical errors.
C. It contains spoofed links.
D. It comes from an unverified source.","A, B, C, D. One of the objectives EC-Council has kept around in its many CEHversions is, and I quote, to “understand phishing attacks.” Part of the official
curriculum to study for the exam covers detecting phishing e-mail in depth,
and all of these answers are indicators an e-mail might not be legitimate. First,
most companies now sending e-mail to customers will reference you by name
and sometimes by account number. An e-mail starting with “Dear Customer” or
something to that effect may be an indicator something is amiss.
Misspellings and grammatical errors from a business are also usually dead giveaways
because companies do their best to proofread items before they are released. There
are, occasionally, some slipups (Internet search some of these; they’re truly funny),
but those are definitely the exception and not the rule.
Spoofed links can be found by hovering a mouse over them (or by looking at their
properties). The link text may read www.yourbank.com, but the hyperlink properties
will be sending you to some IP address you don’t want to go to.
And finally, any e-mail coming from an “unverified source” can and should be viewed
with caution. What makes something an unverified source? That depends on the eye
of the beholder. In many cases, it’s simply an address (or person) you don’t know or
haven’t seen before. In others it’s a very close representation of an e-mail address you’drecognize, but turns out to be malicious.
In any of these cases, your best bet for personal and organizational security is this:
Don’t Click It. It shouldn’t matter to you who the e-mail is from, whether it’s
grammatically perfect, and the links look legitimate—just put yourself in the habit of
not clicking links in e-mail at all. Trust me, you and your organization will be safer.
As an aside, while these are all great answers to a question on an exam, don’t let
them dictate your day-to-day Internet life outside of your exam. A perfectly written,
grammatically correct e-mail containing real links and originating from someone
you trust could still be part of a phishing campaign. Never click a link in an e-mail
without knowing exactly what it is and where it’s taking you—no matter who you
think the message is from or how well written it is. Finally, if you get a phishing e-mail that is accurate, references you by name, has real links, and truly appears tobe accurate, you probably have a real problem on your hands. Everyone gets the
annoying “spam” e-mails with “Click here for free stuff.” However, if you get one that
is delivered to you, with your name and identifying details in it, you have someonewho spent the time to target you specifically, not randomly."

(Choose all that apply.)
A. Phishkill
B. Netcraft
C. Phishtank
D. IDA Pro","B, C. For obvious reasons, there are not a lot of questions from these objectives
concerning tools—mainly because social engineering is all about the human side of
things, not necessarily using technology or tools. However, you can put into place
more than a few protective applications to help stem the tide. There are innumerablee-mail-filtering applications and appliances you can put on an e-mail network
boundary to cut down on the vast amount of traffic (spam or otherwise) headedto your network. Additionally, Netcraft’s phishing toolbar and Phishtank are two client-side, host-based options you can use (there are others, but these are pointed out
specifically in EC-Council’s official courseware).
Netcraft’s (http://toolbar.netcraft.com/) and Phishtank’s (www.phishtank.com/) toolbars
are like neighborhood watches on virtual steroids, where eagle-eyed neighbors can
see suspicious traffic and alert everyone else. The following is from the Netcraft
site: “Once the first recipients of a phishing mail have reported the target URL, it is
blocked for community members as they subsequently access the URL.”
These tools, although useful, are not designed to completely protect against phishing.
Much like antivirus software, they will act on attempts that match a signature file.
This, sometimes, makes it even easier on the attacker—because they know which
phishing will not work right off the bat."
,"An attacker targets a specific group inside the organization. After some time profiling
the group, she notes several websites the individual members of the group all visit on a
regular basis. She spends time inserting various malware and malicious code into some of
the more susceptible websites. Within a matter of days, one of the group member’s systeminstalls the malware from an infected site, and the attacker uses the infected machine as a
pivot point inside the network. Which of the following best defines this attack?
A. Spear phishing
B. Whaling
C. Web-ishing
D. Watering hole attack","D. Have you ever watched nature documentaries on the Discovery Channel? It
seems predators frequently hang out in places where the prey tends to show up. For
example, a pride of lions might just hang out near a watering hole—knowing full
well their prey will eventually just come to them. This attack uses the same principle,
except we’re talking about the virtual world. And none of us are lions (at least not
outside our imaginations, anyway).
In a watering hole attack, the bad guy spends a lot of time profiling the group that
is being targeted (note the key wording in this is that a group is targeted, not an
individual). The attacker can observe or even guess websites the group would visit,
and then infect those sites with some sort of malware or malicious code. Eventually,
someone from the group will visit the virtual watering hole and—voilà—success."
,"Which type of social engineering makes use of impersonation, dumpster diving, shoulder
surfing, and tailgating?
A. Physical
B. Technical
C. Human based
D. Computer based","C. Once again, we’re back to the two major forms of social engineering: human basedand computer based. Human-based attacks include all the attacks mentioned here
and a few more. Human-based social engineering uses interaction in conversationor other circumstances between people to gather useful information. This canbe as blatant as simply asking someone for their password or pretending to be a
known entity (authorized user, tech support, or company executive) in order to gaininformation."
,"In examining the About Us link in the menu of a target organization’s website, anattacker discovers several different individual contacts within the company. To one of
these contacts, she crafts an e-mail asking for information that appears to come froman individual within the company who would be expected to make such a request.
The e-mail provides a link to click, which then prompts for the contact’s user ID andpassword. Which of the following best describes this attack?
A. Trojan e-mailing
B. Spear phishing
C. Social networking
D. Operational engineering","B. Yes, sometimes you’ll get an easy one. Phishing is using e-mail to accomplish thesocial engineering task. Spear phishing is actually targeting those e-mails to specificindividuals or groups within an organization. This usually has a much higher success
rate than just a blind-fire phishing effort."
,"A security admin has a control in place that embeds a unique image into e-mails on
specific topics in order to verify the message as authentic and trusted. Which anti-phishing
method is being used?
A. Steganography
B. Sign-in seal
C. PKI
D. CAPTCHA","B. Sign-in seal is an e-mail protection method in use at a variety of business locations.
The practice is to use a secret message or image that can be referenced on any official
communication with the site. If you receive an e-mail purportedly from the business
but it does not include the image or message, you’re aware it’s probably a phishing
attempt. This sign-in seal is kept locally on your computer, so the theory is that no
one can copy or spoof it."
,"Which of the following should be in place to assist as a social engineering
countermeasure? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Classification of information
B. Strong security policy
C. User education
D. Strong change management process","A, B, C, D. All of the answers are correct, but let’s get this out of the way up front:
you’ll never be able to put anything whatsoever into place that will effectively render
all social engineering attacks moot. You can do some things to limit them, and thoseon this list can definitely help in that regard, but an organization that responds tosocial engineering concerns with “We have a strong security policy and great user
education” is probably one that’ll see a high turnover rate.
Classification of information is seen as a strong countermeasure because the
information—and access to it—is stored and processed according to strict definitions
of sensitivity. In the government/DoD world, you’d see labels such as Confidential,
Secret, and Top Secret. In the commercial world, you might see Public, Sensitive, andConfidential. I could write an entire chapter on the difference between DoD andcommercial labels and argue the finer points of various access control methods, but
we’ll stick just to this chapter and what you need here. As a side note, classificationof information won’t do you a bit of good if the enforcement of access to that
information, and the protection of it in storage or transit, is lax.
Strong security policy has been covered earlier in the chapter, so I won’t waste muchprint space here on it. You must have a good one in place to help prevent a variety of
security failures; however, you can’t rely on it as a countermeasure on its own.
According to EC-Council, user education is not only a viable social engineering
countermeasure but it’s the best measure you can take. Anyone reading this bookwho has spent any time at all trying to educate users on a production, enterpriselevel network is probably yelling right now because results can sometimes be spottyat best. However, the weak point in the chain is the user, so we must do our best toeducate users on what to look for and what to do when they see it. There simply is nobetter defense than a well-educated user (and by “well-educated” I mean a user whoabsolutely refuses to participate in a social engineering attempt). There’s just not that
many of them out there.
A change management process helps to organize alterations to a system or
organization by providing a standardized, reviewable process to any major change.
In other words, if you allow changes to your financial system, IT services, or HRprocesses without any review or control process, you’re basically opening Pandora’s
box. Change can be made on a whim (sometimes at the behest of a social engineer,
maybe?), and there’s no control or tracking of it."

A. Joe and Jill are using single-factor authentication.
B. Joe and Jill are using two-factor authentication.
C. Joe is using two-factor authentication.
D. Jill is using two-factor authentication.","D. When it comes to authentication systems, you can use three factors to prove your
identity: something you know, something you have, and something you are. An itemyou know is, basically, a password or PIN. Something you have is a physical token of
some sort—usually a smartcard—that is presented as part of the authentication process.
Something you are relates to biometrics—a fingerprint or retinal scan, for instance.
Generally speaking, the more factors you have in place, the better (more secure) the
authentication system. In this example, Joe is using only something he knows, whereas
Jill is using something she has (PIV card) and something she knows (PIN)."
,"A system owner has implemented a retinal scanner at the entryway to the data floor.
Which type of physical security measure is this?
A. Technical
B. Single factor
C. Computer based
D. Operational","A. Physical security measures are characterized as physical (door locks and guards),
operational (policies and procedures), and technical (authentications systems and

A. Air conditioning
B. Security tokens
C. Automated humidity control
D. Fire alarms
E. Security policy","B. All security controls are put into place to minimize, or to avoid altogether, theprobability of a successful exploitation of a risk or vulnerability. Logical controls

C. An attacker targets specific members of an organization based on their duties, roles,

D. An attacker inserts malicious code and malware into sites employees visit on a
regular basis.","B. I’m convinced there are folks who sit around doing nothing more than dreamingup new terminology, acronyms, and slang for all of us to remember, and pharming
falls into this category. Pharming has the same end goal as most other attacks—redirecting folks to malicious websites in hopes of stealing something from them.
The method in which it’s done involves updating hosts files and manipulating DNSto point them to a malicious site"
,"Incident response (IR) is an important part of organizational security. In what step of the
incident-handling process would IR team members disable or delete user accounts and
change firewall rules?
A. Detection and analysis
B. Classification and prioritization
C. Containment
D. Forensic investigation","C. In a refrain you’ve heard over and over again throughout this book, sometimes real
life and EC-Council don’t see eye to eye. However, when it comes to IR, ECC kind
of gets it right. Almost. Lots of organizations define the incident-handling response
in different ways, with different phases for actions taken. Generally speaking, though,
all incident handling falls into four sets of actions: identify, contain, eradicate, and
recover. Most organizations will define a preparation phase beforehand and a lessons
learned phase at the end for a full incident process. ECC defines eight phases: • Preparation Defining rules, processes, and toolsets and then testing them (usually
with some regularly scheduled exercises, at a minimum) occur in this phase. • Detection and analysis This is where alerting functions (toolsets, IDS, IPS, users
notifying of strange events, and so on) and initial research into the event take place. • Classification and prioritization Decision making on whether to elevate as
an incident and at what level to elevate is made here (ramping up an IR event for
a false alarm serves no one). Levels of categorization vary from organization to
organization, but usually assign response time frames to levels. • Notification Alerting appropriate teams and organizations to assist in the event
occurs here. • Containment Steps to contain the incident occur here. These may include
steps to revoke or suspend user accounts and blocking system or even subnet
access via a firewall or other method. • Forensic investigation In this stage, if possible, live memory and disk captures
are pulled for evaluation and analysis. This does not have to wait until the
conclusion of the event, but, depending on the assets involved and the nature of
the incident, forensics may have to wait. • Eradication and recovery This phase encompasses all the steps taken to remove
the incident cause (malware, malicious code, backdoors, rootkits, viruses, and so
on) and to return the assets involved to baseline standards before putting themback into production. • Post-incident This is where reporting, follow-up analysis, and lessons learned
are put together. Evaluation from this step is fed into the preparation phase for
the next event.
Questions on incident response and incident handling can be pretty vague. For
the most part, common sense should guide you on anything truly weird, but most
questions will be like this one—fairly easy to figure out on your own. One last notehere: the four phases listed at the beginning of this answer description will more thanlikely be what you’ll see on the exam, so when in doubt, I would stick with them."
,"A software company puts an application through stringent testing and, on the date of
release, is confident the software is free of known vulnerabilities. An organization namedBigBiz purchases the software at a premium cost, with a guarantee of service, maintenance,
and liability. Which risk management method is in use by the BigBiz organization?
A. Accept
B. Transfer
C. Avoid
D. Mitigate","B. Depending on who you talk to, there are as many as seven different methods inrisk management. Of primary concern for you and EC-Council, however, are thesefour: accept, avoid, transfer, and mitigate. In this example, the organization has paida cost to the software developer, trusting them that they’ve tested the software andthat they will assume responsibility and liability for it. In effect, the organization has
transferred the risk to the software company for this application. Transferring risk is
all about finding a different entity to take responsibility for managing the risk, as well
as accepting the liability of an exploitation or loss resulting from the risk."
,"Which of the following provide automated pen-test-like results for an organization?
(Choose all that apply.)
A. Metasploit
B. Nessus
C. Core Impact
D. CANVAS
E. SAINT
F. GFI LanGuard","A, C, D. Automated tool suites for pen testing can be viewed as a means to save time
and money by the client’s management, but (in my opinion and in the real world, at
least) these tools don’t do either. They do not provide the same quality results as a test
performed by security professionals, and they are extremely expensive. Automated tools
can provide a lot of genuinely good information, but they are also susceptible to false
positives and false negatives and don’t necessarily care what your agreed-upon scope
says is your stopping point. Metasploit has a free, open source version and an insanely
expensive “Pro” version for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target
machine—still worlds cheaper than Core Impact, but expensive nonetheless. Metasploit
offers an autopwn module that can automate the exploitation phase of a penetration test.
Core Impact is probably the best-known, all-inclusive automated testing framework. Per
its website (https://www.coresecurity.com/core-impact), Core Impact “takes security
testing to the next level by safely replicating a broad range of threats to the organization’s
sensitive data and mission-critical infrastructure—providing extensive visibility into the
cause, effect, and prevention of data breaches.” Core Impact tests everything from web
applications and individual systems to network devices and wireless.
Per the Immunity Security website (www.immunitysec.com), CANVAS “makes
available hundreds of exploits, an automated exploitation system, and a comprehensive,
reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals.”
Additionally, the company claims CANVAS’s Reference Implementation (CRI) is
“the industry’s first open platform for IDS and IPS testing.”
For you real-world purists out there and for those who don’t have any experience
with any of this just quite yet, it’s important to note that no automated testing suite
provides anything close to the results you’d gain from a real pen test. Core Impact
provides a one-step automated pen test result feature (and probably offers the best
result and report features), Metasploit offers autopwn, and CANVAS has a similar
“run everything” mode; however, all lack the ability to provide results that a true pen
test would provide. In the truest sense of “automated pen testing,” you simply can’t
do it in the real world (for your exam, stick with the three listed here)."
,"Which of the following best describes an assessment against a network segment that tests
for existing vulnerabilities but does not attempt to exploit any of them?
A. Penetration test
B. Partial penetration test
C. Vulnerability assessment
D. Security audit","C. A vulnerability assessment is exactly what it sounds like: the search for andidentification of potentially exploitable vulnerabilities on a system or network. Thesevulnerabilities can be poor security configurations, missing patches, or any number of
other weaknesses a bad guy might exploit. The two keys to a vulnerability assessment
are that the vulnerabilities are identified, not exploited, and the report is simply a
snapshot in time. The organization will need to determine how often it wants torun a vulnerability assessment. Lastly, it’s important to note that there are some
vulnerabilities that simply can’t be confirmed without exploiting them. For example,
the act of infecting SQL statements to expose an SQL injection vulnerability mayvery well constitute an exploit action, but it’s the only way to prove it exists. For your
exam, though, stick with no exploitation during this assessment and move on withyour life."
,"You are a member of a pen test team conducting tests. Your team has all necessary scope,
terms of engagement, and nondisclosure and service level agreements in place. You gainaccess to an employee’s system, and during further testing discover child pornography ona hidden drive folder. Which of the following is your best course of action as an ethical
hacker?
A. Continue testing without notification to anyone, but ensure the information is
included in the final out-brief report.
B. Continue testing without interruption, but completely remove all hidden files andthe folder containing the pornography.
C. Stop testing and notify law enforcement authorities immediately.
D. Stop testing and remove all evidence of intrusion into the machine.","C. If you’ve ever taken any philosophy classes in high school or college, you’ve
undoubtedly read some of the ethical dilemmas presented to challenge black-and-white
thinking on a matter. For example, theft is undoubtedly bad and is recognized as a
crime in virtually every law system on the planet, but what if it’s the only way to save a
child’s life? In ethical hacking, there are fine lines on actions to take when you discover
something, and sometimes hard edges where there is no choice in the matter. Possession
of child porn is a crime, so this case would seem relatively easy to discern. To be fair, and
to make the assumption you’ll need to on questions like this on the exam, your course of
action is straightforward and simple: notify the authorities and let them handle it.
In the real world, things might be a little more difficult. How do you really knowwhat you’re looking at? Are you positive that what you see is illegal in nature
(regardless of what it is—pornography, documentation, letters, and so on)? If you’re
not and you falsely accuse someone, what kind of liability do you face? What about
your team? It’s not an easy question to answer when you’re in the heat of battle, and
you’ll have to largely depend on good, solid pen test agreements up front. Let the
client know what actions will be taken when suspected illegal material is discovered,
and agree upon actions both sides will take. Otherwise you, and your client, could be
in for very difficult times."

The inherent risk of the system is that which is in place if you implement no securitycontrols whatsoever: in other words, there are risks inherent to every system,
application, technology, and service. After you recognize these inherent risks andimplement security controls, you may have some residual risks remaining. In other
words, residual risk is what is left in the system after you implement security controls."

B. The group assisting in the defense of the systems is referred to as a red team.
C. The group assisting in the defense of the systems is known as a white-hat group.
D. The team attacking the systems must provide all details of any planned attack with the
defense group before launching to ensure security measures are tested appropriately","A. Many organizations run full “war game” scenarios, which include defense and
attack groups, to test security measures. Generally speaking, the group doing the
attacking is known as a red team, while the group assisting with the defense is
known as a blue team. The red team is the offense-minded group, simulating the
bad guys in the world, actively attacking and exploiting everything they can find
in the environment. In a traditional war game scenario, the red team is attacking
“black-box” style, given little to no information to start things off. A blue team, on
the other hand, is defensive in nature. The members of the blue team are not out
attacking things; rather, they’re focused on shoring up defenses and making things
safe. Unlike red teams, blue teams are responsible for defense against the bad guys,
so they usually operate with full knowledge of the internal environment.
Blue teams are almost always independent in terms of the target, but their goal
is to assist the defenders and to do so with whatever information is available.
The difference between blue and red in this scenario is in the cooperative versus
adversarial nature: red is there to be the bad guys, do what they would do, look for
the impacts they would want to have, and to test the organization’s defense/response,
whereas blue is there to help."

virtually every security team’s portfolio, and you should definitely spend some timelearning how to use it.
As an aside—not necessarily because it has anything to do with your test but becauseI am all about informing you on how to become a good pen tester—OpenVAS(www.openvas.org) is the open source community’s attempt at a free vulnerabilityscanner. Nessus was a free scanner for the longest time. However, once Nessus was
purchased by Tenable Network Security, it, for lack of a better term, angered a lot of
people in the security community because Nessus became a for-profit entity insteadof a for-security one. Don’t get me wrong—Nessus is outstanding in what it does; it
just costs you money. OpenVAS is attempting to do the same thing for free becausethe community wants security over profit.
Just keep in mind that most vulnerabilities that are actually capable of causing harmto your systems probably won’t be found by any scanner. The recent Heartbleedvulnerability, which takes advantage of an SSL issue, is a prime example: scanners
simply can’t find vulnerabilities we don’t already know about."

the question, you should be okay. Sure, a vulnerability would need to be present;
however, a vulnerability on its own doesn’t cause anything. A threat is somethingthat could potentially take advantage of an existing vulnerability. Threats can be
intentional, accidental, human, or even an “act of God.” A hacker is a threat to takeadvantage of an open port on a system and/or poor password policy. A thunderstormis a threat to exploit a tear in the roof, leaking down into your systems. Heck, a
rhinoceros is a threat to bust down the door and destroy all the equipment in the
room. Whether those threats have intent, are viable, and are willing/able to take upthe vulnerability is a matter for risk assessment to decide; they’ll probably beef uppassword policy and fix the roof, but I doubt much will be done on the rhino front."
,"Which Metasploit payload type operates via DLL injection and is difficult for antivirus
software to pick up?
A. Inline
B. Meterpreter
C. Staged
D. Remote","B. For those of you panicking over this question, relax. You do not have to knowall the inner workings of Metasploit, but it does appear enough—in the variety of
study materials available for CEH certification—that EC-Council wants you to knowsome basics, and this question falls in that category. There are a bunch of different
payload types within Metasploit, and meterpreter (short for meta-interpreter) is one
of them. The following is from Metasploit’s website: “Meterpreter is an advanced
payload that is included in the Metasploit Framework. Its purpose is to provide
complex and advanced features that would otherwise be tedious to implement purely
in assembly. The way that it accomplishes this is by allowing developers to write their
own extensions in the form of shared object (DLL) files that can be uploaded and
injected into a running process on a target computer after exploitation has occurred.
Meterpreter and all of the extensions that it loads are executed entirely from memory
and never touch the disk, thus allowing them to execute under the radar of standard
anti-virus detection.”"
,"Metasploit is a framework allowing for the development and execution of exploit code
against a remote host and is designed for use in pen testing. The framework consists of
several libraries, each performing a specific task and set of functions. Which library is
considered the most fundamental component of the Metasploit framework?
A. MSF Core
B. MSF Base
C. MSF interfaces
D. Rex","D. Once again, this is another one of those weird questions you may see (involving
any of the framework components) on your exam. It’s included here so you’re not
caught off guard in the actual exam room and freak out over not hearing it before.
Don’t worry about learning all the nuances of Metasploit and its architecture before
the exam—just concentrate on memorizing the basics of the framework (key words
for each area will assist with this), and you’ll be fine.
Metasploit, as you know, is an open source framework allowing a variety of
automated (point-and-shoot) pen test methods. The framework is designed in a
modular fashion, with each library and component responsible for its own function.
The following is from Metasploit’s development guide (you can find copies in a variety of places now; just use a Google search for msf_dev_guide filetype:pdf ):
“The most fundamental piece of the architecture is the Rex library, which is short
for the Ruby Extension Library. Some of the components provided by Rex include awrapper socket subsystem, implementations of protocol clients and servers, a loggingsubsystem, exploitation utility classes, and a number of other useful classes.” Rex
provides critical services to the entire framework."
,"Which of the following may be effective countermeasures against an inside attacker?
(Choose all that apply.)
A. Enforce elevated privilege control.
B. Secure all dumpsters and shred collection boxes.
C. Enforce good physical security practice and policy.
D. Perform background checks on all employees.","A, B, C, D. All of the answers are correct. Admittedly, there’s nothing you can reallydo to completely prevent an inside attack. There’s simply no way to ensure everysingle employee is going to remain happy and satisfied, just as there’s no way to tell
when somebody might just up and decide to turn to crime. It happens all the time,
in and out of corporate America, so the best you can do is, of course, the best youcan do.
Enforcing elevated privilege control (that is, ensuring users have only the amount
of access, rights, and privileges to get their job done, and no more) seems like a
commonsense thing, but it’s amazing how many enterprise networks simply ignorethis. After all, a disgruntled employee with administrator rights on his machine cancertainly do more damage than one with just plain user rights. Securing dumpsters
and practicing good physical security should help protect against an insider who wants
to come back after hours and snoop around. And performing background checks
on employees, although by no means a silver bullet in this situation, can certainly help to ensure you’re hiring the right people in the first place (in many companies a
background check is a requirement of law). Here are some of the other steps: • Monitor user network behavior. • Monitor user computer behavior. • Disable remote access. • Disable removable drive use on all systems (USB drives and so on). • Shred all discarded paperwork. • Conduct user education and training programs."
